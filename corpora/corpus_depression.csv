"Depression for me is a constant feeling of wanting to go home, but no matter where I am, I am never home. Even when I’m at my physical home.",That's a good description of it. Good luck on your journey.
Depression is so much worse if you live with your parents.,"This is so true. Its especially true in my culture as an asian because depression is thought of as taboo. Having a child with depression makes them think its the absolute end of the world, that they’ve got a ruined child and they’ve failed in raising me as my parent. 

Its not their fault, but with that mentality we cant share the feelings we have with people who we should feel most safe to talk about our emotions openly, without further feeling like a burden to the whole family. Then that shit spreads like wildfire through the family members 🤦🏻‍♀️"
Shout out to the particular hell that is functional depression.,"I know how you feel. I feel sad and hopeless most of the time, but I always manage to go to work. I guess as hard as it is when I wake up, once I’m there I feel somewhat better."
A stranger just saved my life...,"I’m going to buy someone a hot chocolate today and say something similar, 

;hugs!"
I was going to kill myself tonight,"Fuck, you gave me goosebumps . <3"
"Does anyone ever feel okay for a while, then a wave of depression just hits you like a truck?","Yes it feels like the calm before the hurricane. Some times i feel like my brain has a bucket when he keeps the serotonin, when theres a happy moment he says like ""YES HAPPY MOMENT"" *dumps the whole bucket*, but the next day as my brain spent all the serotonin for the week in the other happy moment theres no more serotonin left. "
"Living with depression is like running a marathon with a broken leg and then having everyone run past you and say “Yeah, yeah, broken leg boo-hoo, we’re all tired.” And then run the same fucking race everyday. The cycle.","To me it's more like I'm paraplegic and without a wheelchair. Someone dumped me at the start of a marathon, and everyone is yelling at me for ""not trying"". A couple of people approach me with ""helpful tips on how to run a marathon"", but when I tell them that I literally cannot move, they get mad and start yelling too. Then, those yelling people are saying that I am lazy, and that I want someone to carry me to the finish line. I'm trying to tell them I am not even interested in running their dumb race, so they call me lazy for not trying. Another group of people approach me with stories about how they used to be paraplegic, or they know someone who's paraplegic, who went on to win a gold medal in the Olympics. They show a picture and said person has an expensive motorized high tech wheelchair. I let them know I can't even afford a foldable lightweight wheelchair, so they look at me confused, then get mad, and then tell me I am not trying hard enough to get that expensive motorized high tech wheelchair. 

23 years of this bullshit. I am tired too man."
"If 10 years ago someone told me that in 10 years I would be routinely sitting in my room all day doing nothing to make myself a successful man but eat, sleep and use my phone/pc and sometimes go out for a lonely aimless walks, I would never believe them",I can't even remember my life ten years ago
"""Depression isn't always at 3am when you're alone with only the thoughts in your head. Sometimes it's at 3pm, when you're surrounded by friends in the middle of laughing."" This is high functioning depression. So many people don't get it.",Yep. You might be able to see it if you know what you're looking for. Otherwise I look a little tired and I'm probably pretty quiet but I'm conversing and even laughing at the right parts. People don't realize how tiring keeping up appearances is or that while they're talking about the weather or work my mind is still on whether or not I'd die if I jumped off the parking garage.  
The worst thing is realising no one is coming to save you and you have to rescue yourself with zero motivation to do so.,This is why I’m so scared to be alone. I don’t trust myself to save myself but no one will save me. I hate this constant battle with myself.
High-functioning depression: I feel like I'm living a double life.,"This would be called Persistent Depressive Disorder. I am not diagnosing you BUT I say look into it. This is exactly what I was diagnosed with along with C-PTSD. 

And it sucks because I feel like I’m not sick enough. Sure I may go days without showering and brushing my teeth. I have crying episodes and I self-harm. Suicidal ideations totally there. But I also go to school. Go out with friends. I have good grades and pass all my classes. And like you, I feel like I’m living a double life. 

There’s been this desire in me lately. One of just escaping. Either through death or through moving to another state. But there’s just this intense desire to get away. And I think that’s where it stems from. I won’t lie, I suffer from an identity crisis. I genuinely don’t know who I really am. I’ve spent my whole life conforming to everyone’s standards just to please them. 

Anyways OP, I hope you’re able to overcome this to whatever extent possible. We all deserve a chance at true happiness."
I cried in front of my family today. They ended up comparing their issues to mine and tell me that other people have it worse.,"That honestly sucks! I hate when parents do that, it’s so annoying and doesn’t help what so ever. Are you okay?"
Does anyone else get extremely bummed out seeing people younger than them doing more with their life?,"Went out with someone who was 23 and is currently making twice as much as me doing a job that requires half the education I have. I felt like shit that I have a 4 year degree and nothing to show for it at 28 years old while people with 2 year degrees, sometimes even college drop outside, making much more money than me because they went into trade jobs. Now I'm just in debt with a worthless piece of paper. No real job skills."
"I want to be alone, but not lonely. I want friends but hate socializing. Want success, but have no desire to be productive. I’m lost in my own conscience.","the biggest thing that i hate about life is how competitive everyone is and is encouraged to be since birth. everything revolves around standing out as an individual and developing talents that you can then sell in the ""market place"".

 but what if you don't care about that? 

what if you derive the most joy out of cooperating with people you enjoy being around, instead of wasting your entire life in a job that you hate? 

i don't really want success, i just want to be able to do whatever i want without worrying about money. the constant worry cripples me and makes it so i don't want to do anything when i do have free time. 

the world just seems like an utterly cold inhuman place.

 it wasn't made for a person like me, but for somebody else. somebody i fundamentally can't relate to."
Does anyone else stay up super late to avoid the next day?,"Yes, every day! It's the only thing exciting in life. Having that irregular bedtime: ""When will I sleep today? I don't know!"" Exhilarating. Plus, you'll probably die sooner so you won't have to deal with life as much."
Does anyone else feel normal one minute then wish you were dead the next?,"Yeah this is me, am always trying to search for a scenario where it would be worth it to continue, but everything seems worthless."
I wouldn't commit suicide but if I had an option to suddenly stop existing I would choose it,"Yeah, for a few years now.  
Mostly because it'd finally bring me some peace, no pressure of letting people down, and no hurt from being let down.

I also don't think I bring much good to the world, so it wouldn't make much difference.

And lately, every day has just been waiting for the next day to come and magically fix everything, which seems like a waste.

But I know this comes and goes, and I'm allowed to have these periods, so I'm just choosing to lay low for a while and wait for an ""up"" period.

How's it work for you?"
Do any of you feel like you're lying or being melodramatic every time you try to talk about your mental health?,"I can't talk about my problems because I tell myself that I'm making a mountain out of a molehill and that most likely I'm just using it to manipulate people by puttintg on a show.

So yeah I know how you feel, it really sucks. I feel I can't really talk to anyone about my problems because of this constant worry."
Had anyone noticed memory decline from depression?,"Yes massively. I can't hold conversations very well, I also lose track of time/space.  I've only just started my recovery process but i'm hoping one day I can go back to remembering stuff"
My therapist died,I’m so sorry for your loss ❤️
does anyone else have a constant feeling of not fitting in or belonging anywhere?,Yes. It's very rare to meet someone that I feel comfortable with. I usually feel like an outsider and like I dont fit in. I long to belong though lol
"The worst part of depression is waking up and the first thought that pops in your head is how shitty you feel, alone and already struggling to get through the day before it’s even started.",We normally don't wake up excited. The biggest issue is that we start to forget the last time we were legitimately happy and then all the days blend together and memories are missing.
Do you ever just stop dead in the middle of whatever you're doing and feel a great wave of existential dread/self-hatred,"Of course, all the time. It fucking sucks."
"Does anyone have a period where they feel really motivated and see things clearly, only to crash even harder the more you try to better yourself, feeling even more depressed than you were originally?","I'm just throwing this out there, but that kind of sounds like mania(hypo?) and the depressive state that follows. Not qualified to diagnose this at all but I do recognize what you are saying(really motivated followed by a crash) in my pattern of moods and I have bipolar disorder type 2. Or it could just be ups and downs of depression and normal state."
"Anyone else ever feel like the “old you” died years ago, and now you’re just limping along as someone you really can’t stand?","Yes.  I used to be cute and I took care of myself.  Now, I constantly quit jobs, have shitty finances, my family is nonexistent as far as I'm concerned and all of the people I know are going on with their lives.  Why was I even born?  This life sucks.  I have dreams all the time that I'm rich and semi famous and I'm fit and happy.  I hate myself so much."
Is anyone else strangely sick of being high functioning?,"Yes. Dear God, yes. Functional depression is such a bitch most days. When strangers ask me what I do for a living, I tell them I’m an actress.

I mean... it’s not a lie, is it?"
Becoming a regular at a local coffee shop changed my life,"This makes me happy. Sometimes it’s hard to find ways to get out of the house when you’re alone. Coffee shops are nice because you *can* be social, but you don’t have to be. 

I’ve been going to a local coffee shop sporadically over the past year, whether it’s to work on art or homework. I haven’t built any lasting connections, but it’s often one of my only ways to get out of my apartment. "
When you realize that you have an incredibly easy life but you’re screwing It up for yourself,Agreed. I feel like a spoiled brat all the time. But I also feel a little deluded and helpless.
The scary part about having depression is when you start to feel down it's hard to know if it's a temporary reaction to life or the start of a relapse,"Everytime things gets better i feel that everything will go wrong and will ruin this, its really annoying (sorry for my english)"
Does anyone else stay up to 3AM every night wanting to die only to get up for school and start the cycle over again every day?,I can relate. I usually stay up really late until I pass out. Waking up to school every single day makes me feel like shit so I have to be quick and get myself ready and on the evening I have to make sure I fall asleep (pass out) before midnight reaches.
"2 years since I dropped out of college due to anxiety and depression, I finally signed back up for classes yesterday.","Congratulations! I did pretty much the same thing, and it was tough but well worth it to go back. Good luck! You got this.  :)"
"I wish I could say ""I was depressed"" the same way I say ""I was sick"" to explain my absence","I just say ""I'm sick."".   
It is true -- mental illness is illness.   
It is none of their issue what ailment I'm suffering from, no obligation or guilt tripping from my side to specify."
"Does anyone else get really happy and motivated for a few hours to a few days, just to fall off the edge again?","Yes.  For me, the motivatated times keep getying shorter and further apart."
"After 1 suicide attempt, and one overdose, I GRADUATED!!!!","Ay mate good job, you've done it. You've managed to get out. Nicely done"
Don't you just want to sleep and sleep and sleep?,Yes. Sleep is the greatest escape I have these days. But then sometimes I get insomnia and can't access it. The worst.
I miss myself,[deleted]
The worst part of depression is that it's stolen my personality,"This doesn’t come off as arrogant or insensitive at all. I know exactly how you’re feeling. It really sucks. I’m a shy, introverted person to begin with, but anxiety and depression has really just killed any semblance of personality. Unfortunately I turn to drinking to get myself out of my bubble. Whenever I hang out with my friends I usually just sit there and don’t say much."
Imagine if the cure to a broken leg was to run a marathon with it. That's what getting help for depression looks like to me.,"Such a perfect analogy. I hate talking about my depression, I stopped after I opened up to someone about it and their response was “just try thinking positive:)” 
Well gee, why didn’t I think of that?! "
Too depressed to have a healthy relationship yet constantly wanting love and affection.,"Depressed because unloved, unloved because depressed."
"We only wish depression was being ""sad"".",I don't know what part of me is depression and what is just my personality
"Alive, barely.",Im really proud of you
I can overhear my mother on the phone laughing and joking about my depression to her friend,"Family is mostly a product of random chance. You don’t owe your family anything except for how they’ve treated you. If your family treats you like this, they don’t have to be a part of your life."
Keeping in touch with friends is so hard when your brain tells you no one wants to talk to you,[deleted]
"After I revealed I’ve had depression for a very long time, a co-worker told me today that I am the most positive and uplifting person at the office to talk to but she’d known something was wrong because of my eyes.","i get that too. people tell me i'm really sweet, but i have sad eyes and there's pain in them. it crushes me that my shitty brain has affected me so bad to the point my face has literally changed from how bright my eyes were as a kid."
It’s not that I want to kill myself. But if I die I wouldn’t be upset.,That's exactly how a feel. Many times when I cross a street I think to not look any direction and just go and whatever happens happens
"Has anyone else went to see a therapist to get help from their severe depression, but once you get there your mind is so hazy and forgetful that it makes it extremely difficult to explain your experience?","Yes! Every time I went and still every time I go to my psychiatry appointments! I can cover maybe one or two things when there's twenty and I remember when I get in the car to leave. The memory problems, concentration, and the brain fog are my least favorite symptoms!"
I almost killed myself today,"I sometimes think that animals can feel when we're down and need their help, at least more so than humans can. I don't know why that is, but I am glad your little guy was there for you, and that you are still with us."
"When I’m sitting on my ass doing nothing, I feel useless and depressed. When I’m actually doing something, i think about how I’d rather be just relaxing at home","I have this too. No motivation to do anything whatsoever, but no ability to rest either. As soon as I sit down, a voice tells me I'm lazy, useless and unproductive. A friend I talked to thinks it's related to upbringing and how strictly your parents pushed you. 

Ps: I just noticed you commented on my last post. Thanks and take care!"
"Do you ever feel that the deeper in depression you are, the dumber you become?","Yeah, all the time. I'm totally incapable of studying when I'm really depressed. I can't remember anything, I can read something 10 times and still manage to not understand it. You're not alone, don't worry. Try going for a walk when it happens or take a cold shower. It doesn't always work, but sometimes it does."
Does anybody else ever stay up late so they can avoid tomorrow?,"Yes. Also, I like to just have the night to myself. There's something calming about the night time when most things are asleep."
"A Depressed persons vocabulary ""I'm fine"" ""Im okay"" ""nah I'm just tired"" ""it's not a big deal"".","I always jut say im tired, and people believe it. They just leave me alone after"
"When I don’t have a job, I want a job. When I have a job, I don’t want a job. When it’s hot, I want it to be cold. When it’s Fucking cold, I want it to be hot. When I’m myself I want to be with people, when I’m with people I want to be by myself",[deleted]
"Too depressed to be productive, and not depressed enough to kill myself",I know exactly how you're feeling.. I'm feeling it right now
"I hope being dead is like sleeping,because im tired,i really am,i just want to sleep forever and never wake up again","That's so relatable. I have a bad habit of sleeping for at least 14 hours a day -- and sometimes up to 20. I just can't stand to be awake anymore and even though just about everyone in my life says I need to fix this, I don't want to. Sleep is like a step-up from death. If I can't have death, at least let me have sleep."
I feel like I’m addicted to depression.,"Holy fuck yes. I spent a good portion of the weekend listening to depressing music on repeat and just wallowing in my misery. I believe it's called ""fetishizing your pain"" and definitely isnt healthy. I've found I've gotten better about not doing that as much as I used to, and also dont seek out drugs to numb my pain as much (nobody's perfect though, definitely snorted a xanax last night to calm myself down.) Try and distract yourself instead, I've been obsessively reading these posts and trying to offer advice to others, and I feel a little better as a result..."
"I feel like I'm getting stupider, less talented, clumsier, and that soon I will be completely retarded.","Child prodigy —> talented —> clever —> average —> incompetent 

Never quite sure if it was the depression or just me peaking early and falling early. "
An unexpected side effect of depression: the decline of cognitive capabilities,"Sadly I get this a great deal, and it drives me crazy, I am sorry your going through it as well. I used to be able to watch a TV show or movie and care about it, now I have to pause ever 15 or 30 minutes and wait, watching a show or film can take me all day, I just can't bring myself to give a shit about pretend. I loved to read, I read a book a week or more from 8 until 32 years old. For the next 4 years of depression I read 5 books. 

And in the last 2 years of recovery and therapy things have improved, but more in other ways, now its still only a book every 2 months, wildly different than most of my life. I never did social media at all before I got on Reddit less than 2 years ago, not of any kind. Reddit is different, I still don't do anything else, and I do like it here and the people I have met, but I do notice I am on here 3 to 6 hours every day. I feel like I am coasting intellectually on things I already learned, ideas I already formed, philosophy I already believed, and more than anything thoughts I have already thought. 

This is the thing that is most for me, I am articulate and well read enough, with enough evidence based and fully formed opinions, that I can appear intelligent in all likelihood forever. But that is not the point. Intellect is nothing if one does not grow, does not learn and change, does not reach. It is improving with therapy and such, but in truth it is quite slow. The memory, concentration and motivation issues are incredibly frustrating, it bothers me because I want it and am trying hard, yet redeveloping it is proving so difficult. I wish I had answers besides continuing to move forward and to keep trying things, keeping those that prove effective over time. But its really irritating in truth, I can empathize a great deal."
Anyone like being in the shower not for the purpose to get clean but standing in the water while the hot water just runs through your body while you just stare,"I read somewhere that lonely people take longer warm showers cause the warmth almost mimics emotional warmth. 

I love hot showers "
Today I woke up and didn’t want to die.,"Wow. The title just about gave me goosebumps.. I vividly imagined waking up one day and *not* wanting to simply cease to exist. The dark cloud, weight on your shoulders, prison cell inside your mind, whatever you want to call it, just... wasn't there anymore. Immediately experiencing a rush of contentment and peacefulness, that for most people, comes naturally. 

Im so incredibly fascinated with that idea, because it just seems so foreign, so unreal to me. 

I can in a sense understand why to the average person, ""today I woke up, and I didn't feel like dying!"" Does not seem like a huge accomplishment. But I'm sure the people here understand.

Gives me some hope that maybe some day will be my day. :) so so happy for you!"
Fun fact: when I was younger many people told me I was a gifted child of above average intelligence.,I know what you mean I can be told things a thousand times but if its something important I immediately forget it if it's not important I can remember it down to the last detail. It's really annoying.
"the worst thing about depression,is seeing everyone around you progress in their life and you are stuck in the same place","As the lyrics say: 
""And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gun"""
Anyone else barely hanging on to life with no motivation whatsoever?,[deleted]
"Anybody feel like you died long ago, and you're just a zombified shell?",I feel like my humanity was burned away long ago and I'm just a walking meat archive of knowledge and experiences.
Is anyone else hating the fact that they’re wasting time of their life as you’re witnessing it all go in the drain because of their stupid mental illness holding you down?,"I mean, I spend my whole life just in my room watching YouTube and I hate it but I’m too anxious to go outside, and I don’t really have any friends so it’s hard for me to find things so do. And it’s mostly cuz of bloody anxiety and ocd stopping me. Edit: Thanks for all the support!"
Do you ever get so empty you’re excited when you finally start crying because at least you’re feeling an emotion?,When I go from empty to sad and so pissed off I hyperventilate
Mom died last night going to be needing all your love and support.,"it’s going to be ok buddy. i’m here for you and i’m sure everyone else on this sub is. you just have to be strong. not the strongest in the world, but the strongest person YOU can be. your mom would love that."
"anyone else get super motivated at night to get your life together, then when it's daytime that motivation is gone?",Every god damn day
Anyone been depressed for so long they don't even know if they are depressed or if they are just really boring?,[deleted]
"I don’t live for myself anymore, I only live so my mom doesn’t have to go through the pain of me committing suicide","I feel the same way. . .

I’m not staying alive for myself. I’m staying alive for everyone else."
"The reality of depression: Yesterday I was googling ""most effective suicide methods"". Today I feel fine.","I relate to this so much. When I'm feeling fine I can't imagine feeling depressed, it's like some half forgotten dream. When I'm severely depressed (like now) I just cannot imagine ever feeling better, even though I have too many times to remember. Maybe this is where journalling can be helpful. It's hard proof that things DO change. We are in constant flux. Trying desperately to make myself believe this right now."
Does anyone else find it increasingly hard to pretend to be a normal functioning human being?,"It's hard to pretend you are cool when you are actually in the worst depths of hell. 

I feel you."
"Do you ever doubt the validity of your depression? And just think that the reason you can’t do normal things, is just because you’re a bad person?","I'm depressed because I'm a bad person 

and

I'm a bad person because I'm depressed"
"I’m a Christmas person, but this year I’m just... empty.",Merry christmas you too
"Fuck this shit dude, how in the hell is anyone supposed to keep up with scjool, work, social life, healthy eating + exercise, and hobbies?","I have no clue! I can barely relax nowadays, I’m always on the edge. I’ve been studying and working my ass off all day because of all the tests and homework, I can barely calm down except for the weekends which are short. 

I can barely feel anything, I just feel numb. I hope that the pain will end soon, I just want to relax."
Nobody gives a fucking shit about you until you mention killing yourself.,"Then if you mention wanting to kill yourself or not wanting to be alive, people think you’re just doing it for attention. It’s actually sickening"
I shouldn't have to lie about my depression to get a sick day,"I keep wanting to take a sick day but feel too guilty about lying about the reason so I just force myself to go to work anyway, because I feel like I'm being lazy if I take a sick day due to depression :("
Absolutely nothing interests me anymore. I fucking hate it.,"I feel the same way. I spend the week-end all alone in my dark room. Twitter, Reddit, Twitter again. Everyone around me seems so happy. But me... I can't remember the last time I was interested at something. 

I used to make music, to go out with friends, to play video games, read comics. Now I have maybe 2, 3 friends. I barely speak to my family, I do nothing. I ruined everything. I feel like I can't be happy anymore. And I am only 27..."
Anyone else get lost in their daydreams and get hit with a wave of depression when you snap back to reality?,Definitely. Sometimes I get even more depressed knowing how much time I spend daydreaming instead of making friends and actually doing things.
I deleted my note!,Proud of you
Sleeping is the only activity I don't hate because it's like a free trial of not existing,"That's how I feel right now.  I'm at the in between stage of wanting to curl up in the corner screaming like an animal while tearing my skin off just to feel something else and not feeling anything at all.  I don't know what's worse . . . I want to fall asleep and never wake up and it scares me.  I'm at work, 12 hour shift, and I don't have anyone to turn to right now.  So, I thought I'd find those who understand on here."
My girlfriend cheated on me with one of my best friends while I was at the psych ward for trying to kill myself. Someone please cheer me up,"Fuck em both, sorry for the language but you deserve better. I know you are able to be strong enough to continue, and I assure you that you will find someone who will actually treat you well in the future."
Why I stopped opening up.,Bottling up might be unhealthy but I'm not sure opening up to people who don't understand is healthy or not.
Does anyone else experience anger as a part of depression?,"Yes, I get extremely angry with the people around me. The one positive to come out of my anger is that I can use that anger to fuel exercise. I don't get rid of my anger, I just redirect it."
How many other people go to sleep wishing they'll die peacefully before they wake up?,"I’m with you on this one. I wish I could donate my time on earth to someone who would actually make good use out of it. It sucks that many people who contribute to this world get cancer and die while people like me live despite not wanting to. I’m tired of feeling like a piece of shit all the time. I wish I could either stop feeling this way or be brave enough to actually go through with it. Instead I’m totally useless and stuck here not enjoying life but also hanging in there only because I feel like I could never take my own life. On top of that I feel guilty because there’s nothing wrong with my life. My parents still pay for everything. I’m in university. I just feel like a failure and my major is shitty and it won’t get me anything in life because I’m too stupid to do what I dream about doing. and overall I’m a very anxious person who can’t deal with life situations. I worry about everything and can’t do anything by myself. I live in a shitty country with shitty government and people who hate everyone who isn’t a straight, white person. I’m just a piece of shit tbh, my parents deserve a better child. I would be happy to die by an accident so nobody could blame me and wonder what they could have done.  I understand other people have it worse but I’m just really having a very shitty time here on earth and the thought of being alive for let’s say the next 50 years absolutely terrifies me."
"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?","You should show that you care, and stay with her, she needs it now more than ever.

EDIT: Not to mention how much you will regret not being there for her.


I hope she has a quick recovery."
I'm breaking apart and no one gives a fuck.,"Also, future me, if you're reading this post.

Yes you are depressed, no you're not faking, ~~normal~~ healthy people don't feel this way.

Stop overthinking.

You deserve help but next appointment tell her how much you feel like you don't deserve it and you know it's irrational but you can't shake it off.

EDIT: To anyone else who's reading and needs to hear this: your feelings ARE valid.
Also, this community is amazing and you all are making me feel warm and fuzzy inside."
Does anyone else sleep a lot to escape the pain?,"absolutely. i love sleeping so much. i dont want to live but i dont want to die, i just want to sleep. and wake up only to eat, watch some movies, then sleep again and repeat."
Suicide ice cream,This was an oddly uplifting story. 
I’m killing myself [update],I remember reading your last post. I didn’t respond to it because I saw it 6 hours after and you weren’t responding anymore. My heart sank and I assumed the worst. I am really happy to see that you’re here.
"People don't realize that coming over and just sitting with you, watching tv or having food or whatever, while you're depressed is the best feeling.","Sooooo true. My neighbour is one of my only best friends from growing up and we hardly ever see each other but when she comes round, I feel so much better about everything. Talking with her makes me feel motivated and better about life, I don’t think she realises the affect it has on me."
"Does anyone habitually say things like ""I fucking hate myself""","I was driving once and caught myself in the middle of calling myself a useless, pathetic sack of shit.

I mean seriously, that's just mean"
Being alive is a scam,"I haven't related to a sentence more.. ""being alive is a scam"" you're so fucking right. I'm able to breathe so I guess that means I'm either gonna slave away my whole life at a shitty job or be homeless"
Does anyone feel like the less interesting person while hanging around other people?,always. whenever im in a group w other people i get quiet after a few minutes just to try and not annoy anyone
"“People with depression don’t want to die, they just don’t want to be alive”",I just don't want my life. I want a refund or exchange it
I´ve been told my whole childhood how intelligent I was. Now I can't live up to those expectations put upon me by others and myself. I feel like a failure.,"Sorry that you're going through this.  It's the natural result of being fed a diet of ""junk praise"" in early life, where you get validation for your natural abilities instead of your efforts and your choices.  It leads to what's most commonly called a ""fixed mindset"", one of the characteristics of which is an inability to learn from mistakes and recover from setbacks, so, just as you describe, you end up steadily losing momentum compared to the peer group that you started out ahead of.  

The pre-eminent psychology research on this stuff is Carol Dweck; you might find her writing on this helpful.  [Here's an in-depth review of her mainsteam book](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/).  "
"Anyone else have underlying sadness even when doing something ""fun""?","Sometimes I’ll be with friends laughing and then I just suddenly stop as I realise I’m mostly just pretending. I’m not actually happy, this is just a mask to make others think I’m fine."
Realizing that you will die because of suicide is really hard.,"I have this mindset a lot, i feel sometimes I've fucked my life to point that there is no fixing it, in a way i have I'm very isolated by my own choosing and I've given up on a lot"
I wish I could give my life to someone who actually wants to live,I’ve been thinking the same thing. Everyday people who are loved and needed die and yet I’m still here day after day. It’s not fair.
Anybody else feel like they're quietly panicking all of the time?,"Yes, gotta love Generalized Anxiety Disorder."
"Do you ever lay there in the dark, just staring into the nothingness, and then 5 hours went by somehow and you cant remember if you fell asleep or not.","Yes. And then get up and think about how great it would be to be in bed. And then while lying down, think about how great it would be to up when no one else is...and on and on and on."
Feel like I'll never be able to have a normal loving relationship because of my depression and my personality,I’m not even going to have a relationship.
"I convinced myself I was going to commit suicide sometime in the next 2 weeks. Then I walked to the kitchen and saw my beautiful, loving family. Now I cant stop crying","Then live for them. If you can’t do it for yourself do it for them. I know the same way you feel. I was so adamant on killing myself and finally leaving and I found someone to live for. Someone who actually needs me. My therapist told me if you can’t live for yourself find someone to live for to keep you going a little longer. It doesn’t always have to be you. Once they pass on if you haven’t found a new reason thats completely fine. You lasted that long and that’s amazing and I’ll be very proud of you. But if you can’t then that’s fine also. You lasted as long as you did and that’s amazing as well.


Edit: y’all are gonna make me cry 😭

And too add more. It doesn’t always have to be people!! It can be your fur babies as well. Anything that has a huge significance in your life. Make that your reason to live. Something to just keep you going. Anything. But if you can’t hold on any longer I wish you nothing but a quick and painless passing. And you move on with no pain ❤️❤️"
i’ve just started answering “no” when people ask if i’m okay,The sad thing is they don't really care in my experience.
"Anyone else feel like their ""fake depressed""?",It's the reason we take so damn long to get help. Nothing but a vicious cycle tbh. A few days ago I saw Major Depressive Disorder written on my script for the first time and yet I still doubt myself.
"Depression is the hot funny meme until you're not sleeping, not eating, and hoping you'll die in a car accident",It isnt funny but I still end up laughing at those jokes despite feeling depressed. It's just the way I express my fake comfort with peoples appropriation of something they're unwilling to understand.
Anyone feels jealous and bitter that you’re stagnating while everyone around you is moving forward?,Not jealous or bitter (I don't think) but deeply sad and sometimes quite angry at myself that I can't seem to just snap out of it
One of the shittiest feelings is having a dream where you're genuinely happy then waking up to reality.,"I know how you feel. That's happened to me all this week. :/
I wake up a few times, but I just go back to sleep and hope the dream is still there."
"Does anyone else get random moments of clarity where you think ""oh crap, I'm actually very mentally ill.""","I was recently diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I’d spent years thinking that everyone felt that way, and it wasn’t until I had several breakdowns at work that I finally saw my GP. They wanted to sign me off work, but I fought it for a while because I felt guilty at the thought of being at home for something that’s “all in my head”. Had a really bad breakdown, work referred me to Occupational Health, and they finally convinced me to accepted being signed off.

Started counselling shortly afterwards, and I now realise that I’d been ill for a long time. I still feel guilty at being off work, but I’m slowly accepting that mental health is no different to physical health; you need to have time to heal, and pushing it too far or too early is just going to end with you getting hurt."
nobody cares when you're depressed until you commit suicide,"I used to think this, and I've brought up my suicidal ideation with several friends now and it's changed my view.

Firstly, they don't know what to say, which I expected. There's not much they can do right?

But what shocks me is after I bring it up, they don't check on me. I go days off contact, no-one reaches out.

Genuinely think if I died in my flat, the first one to notice would be my boss. If I committed suicide on the Friday evening, I probably wouldn't be found until Tuesday. Scary thought"
Why the fuck does being alive always have to feel like an uphill battle. I can't fucking ever keep up.,"Please remember that depression is a liar.

It will tell you that you're not doing well enough, even when you are.

It will tell you that you've always felt this awful, even when you've had easier periods in the past.

It will tell you that you'll never feel any better, when the objective odds are, you likely will.

The biggest lie it tells you is that you are not worthy.

You are worthy. You deserve to feel better. You deserve help. Please reach out for it, even if it feels useless right now. Just use your suspension of disbelief, and reach...

Xxx"
I wish I could have a fatal accident instead of committing suicide.,"Wow, this was hard to read because I feel for you. I’ve wanted this same scenario to happen to me, yet I’m not a father nor husband. 

I hope you will be able to grow and overcome your clear pain, for you and your wellbeing. 

Good luck."
"Nobody cares if you're suicidal, only if you commit suicide","Depression is a very, very difficult thing to understand. 

People fear what they can't understand. And people can't understand a feeling they've never felt before. Just as people with lifelong depression can't imagine what healthy is like, healthy people can't understand what depression is like. 

They don't not care. They're afraid. Afraid that if they give bad advice, the blame will be shifted to them. They will be the reason you ""proved it"". 

The best way to obtain help, is by being direct, blunt, and you're going to need to explain that nothing they say, can make things worse. Whether that is true or not, it's going to be how a healthy person needs to feel in order for them to be able to help. They are also going to need to know how to help, what can they do. 

Depression is tricky. Because while we are the sick ones, in order for us to get help from non professionals, we need to take care of them before they can take care of us. It sucks, it's embarrassing, it's awkward, and it's painful. But sometimes, it's what has to be done in order to stop the sickness. 

People care. They just don't know how to care, until you tell them. "
I'm getting more and more stupid.,"I find myself forgetting words so I have to just go ""it's like [word] but not quite what I mean."" and I just feel so stupid. I know I can learn anything I'm passionate about but I'm scared of trying because I know my depression will hold me back big time."
I’ve been diagnosed for 20 years - yesterday I quit my $100k+ high pressure sales job to become an 8th grade science teacher.,Wait until you teach them about anything todo with sex 
I had a personality once but now I can't remember who i am,"Good morning--or whatever. Lol

I feel the same way often. I feel like my memory is terrible too sometimes. 

I think it's a form of disassociation. You're somewhere in your head instead of in the moment. Therapy can help a lot with that. They can teach you exercises to help bring you back to earth. Won't lie, it's not a sure fire fix. But if it works 1/100 times, we can call that a win. 

Thank you for sharing. Now we both know we're not alone."
"God dammit. I should be able to tell people I have suicidal thoughts sometimes without them freaking the fuck out. I feel like killing myself sometimes. There, I said it. Doesn't mean I'm going to do it.","You hit the nail on the head. We all have suicidal thoughts almost every day... because depression. Depression does that. And we’re all comfortable talking about it here. People who are not depressed, on the other hand have a knee jerk reaction to thoughts around death... they actively avoid thinking about it, don’t want to talk about it. I had a psych prof who talked about the fact that although we are all going to die some day, it’s such an overwhelming thought that we have coping techniques and kind of denial around the idea of not existing (spirituality etc). I really see it now. People who are not depressed way overreact to hearing about it or talking about it. There’s a post here somewhere about some poor high school kid who tried to talk to his counselor about his depression and suicidal thoughts... and she called an ambulance immediately and got taken to hospital against his will. Got released, but it cost his parents $1000, NOT HELPFUL. I mean, we’re the ones with a diagnosed mental health issue and yet we have to deal with irrational stuff like this. Then the medical community wonders why people won’t seek help. Anyways, talk about it all you want here. Nobody’s gonna trip out"
"Depression is when you don't really care about anything, anxiety is when you care too much about everything. And having both is just like hell.","It's a double dose cocktail of ""fuck you"", I know what you're talking about :/ It sort of forces you to watch yourself achieve nothing, and then makes yourself feel bad about it. "
"Cheers to everyone on here, this sub is the only place I feel accepted. We may be depressed, but we are never dicks to one another or reject each other's voices.",Cheers to you too
Nobody talks about the memory loss,"When I talked about this in consultations with psychologists and psychiatrists it didn't seem to be given too much importance... And it's one of the things that has done the most damage to my life and my self-esteem. Along with tiredness for me is the worst. Over the years has worsened. I wonder how much can be recovered or improved, if that's possible to begin with."
"It gets better, but it never STAYS better.","Life is a series of ups and downs, I just wish the ups weren't so brief and the downs so long."
"Woke up, realized it was Christmas, and broke down sobbing.",[deleted]
Does anyone else get those little highs that last like 10-15 seconds where you feel like you can do anything and are genuinely motivated and no one can stop you..but then it passes and you're back to feeling like complete shit?,My entire life is like trying to get the broken earbud to work by slowly moving the wire around
It’s my 25th birthday today. Even though I don’t mind living in solitude and actually prefer it often due to my mental illness symptoms— birthdays remind me how much it is my own fault and my mental illness made me lose all friends in my life and that I truly am alone.,"Happy birthday. I know that clearly is a backwards statement, but, I hope it’s a better day than usual. 🐙"
Does anyone else wish that you could sleep forever?,Yea. My first thought of the day when I wake up is “fuck”
I feel like mental illness is the only medical condition where people wished they had cancer instead,"When I was a child, I wished I had some physical thing so people could feel some empathy. 
I used to be surrounded by arseholes. 

Mental illnesses are the Western leprocy"
"Anyone else used to be bright in school, but now feel like a bum?","yeah, being the 'smart kid' in school didn't do anything for social connection, and instead of being offered opportunities like 'here try this welding internship' you are told 'you have infinite potential. go out and do whatever you want!'  


i won't tell you what I do with my infinite potential, but I am certainly bitter about a lot of high school things."
Anyone else just feel bored of everything?,"I very much so feel this way. Can't play video games, can't watch tv/movies much. I just sit in my chair at home until bedtime and then I do it all over again the next day. Don't even get the same pleasure from food anymore."
Anyone else stay awake late just because the idea of “tomorrow” feeling exactly like today is such a depressing thought?,"I'm fixing to go into work without any sleep because I am dreading starting another work week, seriously depressing stuff knowing I just get to be free 2 out of 7 days my entire life"
I (attempted) suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 km/h and walked out with a minor concussion. I feel like it's a sign I need to step up my action against depression. What are some things I can do to alleviate my depression?,"People usually say exercise helps for energy, maybe go for a walk once a day? Even if you don't feel like it."
Anyone else feel like they can’t learn shit?,"Chronic stress, which occurs in depression, leads to brain changes in the hippocampus resulting in less formation of new brain cells and poorer memory. That's probably what you're experiencing. The good news is that it should be completely reversible through lifestyle and medication, for most. I've been trying to exercise a lot and I take omega 3 supplements in attempt to cancel it out. I feel like it has definitely helped significantly, although I haven't recovered completely."
Hate when normal people ask me what I've been doing all day and I have to lie.,"I keep trying to tell people that this is what my life is 90% of the time and they don't believe me. Basically when I say that I spent weeks/months not going out and not doing anything, they start telling me that I shouldn't believe everyone's Instagram life and nobody is out there having fun all the time. Sure, I'm not an idiot, but the point is that I don't go anywhere in the morning or the evening or the weekend or xmas etc. It frustrates me to no end that because I present as a chipper, educated middle-class westerner, people don't believe anything I tell them about my life. I've been homeless, I've been stuck in a really messed-up pattern that's kept me socially isolated and at home for huge periods of time, and whenever I think I can tell someone, they just dismiss me and my despair increases."
i'm not doing any better i just got better at hiding it.,"I sympathasize 100%.  If being depressed for so long has taught me anything in this life, its how to fake happiness.  I think we surprise ourselves at how good we can be, but I feel like a hollow shell of what used to be me.  Know you're not the only one out there.  "
Anyone else feel like maybe you are just starting to get it together and then one little f*&# up sends you plummeting into the abyss again?,"I decided I'd have a proper breakfast to try to start the day out right today. Scrambling some eggs, I set the dish on the counter to check the heat of the pan. The fork slips and liquid egg spills all across the counter and down the crack where the counter doesn't meet the edge of the stove. Much cursing but I'm not going to let it win. I pull out the stove and get all the egg goo cleaned up, reset the stove and grab a couple of new eggs. I was determined not to let this get to me. Eggs in the pan I start some much needed coffee. Coffee done I pour it into a mug and quickly realise I'm out of coffee cream so the coffee goes in the sink. I quickly toss some bread in the toaster and attend the eggs. This is not going to get to me. I toss some bacon in the eggs and slap it on the toast once it's done.

I sat down with my breakfast sandwich trying to calm myself down. ""I will be productive today. I will-"" I noticed the bread bag looks suspiciously green/blue. I looked down at my half eaten breakfast in my hands. The bread I was eating was mouldy.

I gave up. Tossed the rest of my breakfast and the bread in the compost and take it out. I haven't left the house in a week and I obviously need to go shopping but depression wins again today. 

I just wanted a nice breakfast."
I want someone to notice how not okay i really am,"Wow I relate to this so much. 
I’m so fed up of pretending to be okay and just wish someone would see how fucking miserable I actually am."
It hurts realizing who you really are,"When I was in my young teens I thought I was this calm and smart guy, who was just waiting for his chance to show the world who he was. After attempting to become more social and outgoing, I just realized that I am a trash person. Now I just try to regress back into what I was, because at least I'm not going to ruin other peoples day anymore."
“I used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone“,"In a world where communication is at our finger tips, we as people have never felt more alone."
I wish i could transfer all my remaining days to someone who actually enjoys living.,This stopped me in my tracks. What hurts is that we do want to enjoy living ... so bad
"25, an aging, worthless failure","If you are taking care of your needy family, then you are the opposite of a worthless failure."
"I am so tired of ""just taking it one day at a time""","I just wanted to post about this. Every day is torture. I finally make it through the work week a d what is my reward?

A weekend of torturous suicidal thoughts which I have been burying for the whole week, now blowing up in my face and ruining that weekend thats the only time I can hope to ""relax"".

Then the weekend is over in seemingly 5 minutes anyways, a d then what?

All over again

Thats the thing, there is nothing to look forward to except death. Thats the only real rest, everything else is just layers and layers of problems stacked on top of each other, and every day repeats forever"
"I hate myself so much I actually repeat the phrase ""I hate myself"" to myself multiple times a day.","I do too... Tbh its almost unconcious. I have intrusive thoughts a lot and I dont know when it started, but if I have an intrusive thought about something shitty from my past or something else bad pertaining to me I find myself saying ""die"" over and over again. Its awful and while its not totally dissociative (as in I normally dont do it in public) I cant always help it.

Ive been told it reinforces the negativity and I believe it, but its so difficult to stop, its as natural/unconcious now as yelling in pain or saying hello to a friend"
Made a new friend,"Sorry, what does the semicolon mean?"
I wish there was just an off button for life.,I wish it too. A button to turn off as long as someone want without giving everything up at once just to rest as long someone needed.
Ever not speak a single word in a whole day?,Yep. When you have to speak again your voice comes out soft and quiet :/
I have no personality,"I can relate to this so much! I feel like the real me is hidden somewhere deep inside of me and is screaming to get out. I think we all can relate to that and the feeling of disassociation. 

I’m glad you came here. I hope you’ll feel welcomed and supported here"
Does anyone else want to kill themself but they don’t want to do that to their family so they go by day by day with the only true motivation in their life being the day they finally grow distant enough from their family that they can end it all without the guilt,"Shit man I even started a relationship too and the same thing goes through my head and you’ve just put it in writing.

My fam has my other siblings, I don’t talk to any of my family, I’m overseas, I broke my relationship with my closest friends here, I feel like these would probably be the best conditions I could get but then my bf came into my life."
Does anyone weirdly find comfort in their depression?,[deleted]
Did anyone else's depression fuck up their career or university/schooling experience?,"I was a high achieving high school student and moved across the country to attend a small liberal arts college. Totally lost it my second semester and ended up leaving in the middle of my third semester. I attended community college back home and felt like a failure. My friends all graduated from great universities on time. I failed sooo many classes out of boredom and frustration. My transcript is a mess. Changed my mind about my career path more times than I can count. Only within the past 3 years did I start working full time.

I just turned 30, and honestly, I'm fine with it now. I hit snags, but I overcame them. Without all my failures, I wouldn't be where I am now. My career goals are finally clear, and I have zero fear of making the wrong decision. All the classes I failed didn't matter in the long run. My friends are honestly not any better off than I am. I still suffer from depression, but I no longer feel regret over my education and career progress. Shit happened, got other stuff to worry about now.

All this to say, chances are it will get  better, and you will be wiser for the experience. What you're going through now is hard. Let yourself feel bad about it. It sucks. But don't let those feelings take you down, or at least go down fighting."
It's lonely.,"It’s very strong if you to admit your feelings and cry them out, don’t let them torture you, get them out, cry as much as you’d like. 

I know how it feels. These past few months have been hell and I want it to end : ("
"i don’t wanna kill myself, but i don’t want to necessarily exist either?",I feel the same way. I don’t want to do it either but life seems so boring and pointless sometimes. I’m sick of my mood swings.
"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",Understood and I apologise if I forget in the future and break it
Has anyone ever felt they won’t ever reach their full potential because of their depression?,"All the time. It sucks when I have really productive periods, where I’m on top of everything and feel like I’m actually making progress. When the depression hits it’s like I’m starting all over again, and constantly. It’s a horrible cycle, like, if only I could’ve kept going I wonder how far I would’ve got by now. But I also understand with this illness, there are certain things I can’t do. I’m going to be slower going at some things. I’m going to have days where I don’t leave the house.

I’m trying to come to terms with this. There’s a way to make life work, I just have to find the right way for myself."
Anyone else previously cared way too much and now is completely apathetic to everything?,"Now that I'm depressed I don't care about important stuff like work or school, but I can break down and cry about the smallest thing like someone raising their voice at me. It's pretty weird because you go from completely dead inside to an emotional mess in a matter of seconds."
Scared of sleeping because tomorrow will start,I've done this for a few years now.
Have you ever had to physically “fight” with your own mind just to keep yourself together?,I am doing this as we speak. My brain is telling me to get drunk and kill myself. My soul is fighting like a motherfucker to keep me from listening to my brain. So maybe if I stop the brain the soul will have some peace. I hope we both figure this shit out. Because I’m falling apart
I wanted to kill my self last night but instead I called an ambulance,"If it’s not rude to ask, what happened? Did one come out? What did they say? 
Sorry for my curiosity in the time of your pain, I am glad you took control of the situation. <3"
Do you ever feel too ugly to leave the house?,"i just don't leave the house at all unless it's absolutely necessary, i like my solitude and isolation as it makes me feel secure and comfortable."
Anybody ever been depressed since a child but only realised it was depression when you got older?,Working with my therapist; we were able to trace it back as far as age 7. I wasn’t however diagnosed until I was 41.
y’all ever just give up mid-day and zone the fuck out and start staring into space for prolonged periods of time?????,"Yeah I do this all the time, my mind goes back and forth to the past and future"
Do you ever just cry for the person you used to be?,The person I could have been.
I fucking hate being depressed all the time,I feel this shit. Put it perfectly
"You ever want to cry but, physically can’t","Yes, and it’s fucking horrible"
"i want to tell people ""don't worry, i hate myself way more than you could ever hate me""",That's how I've been feeling a lot lately.
You’re depressed because you’re not grateful,"It's such a confusing statement because all it does is create guilt and/or accuse someone of having no awareness. 

Like damn, I'm aware of what I have and I'm grateful for it. But this is a separate issue entirely."
"Nobody at all cares how depressed you are when you're alive, as long as you don't kill yourself. Now if I kill myself, then I'm just a huge selfish jerk who didn't think about anybody. Jerks...","And once you're dead they all sit around asking ""Why didn't they ever say anything? If only they'd asked for help."""
Does anyone else hurt so much emotionally that it feels physical?,"Yeah, have felt it a lot, it feels like there is a vacuum in the chest or something very heavy is placed there. 
Now my head hurts the most trying to stop getting into overthinking. And when I not overthinking and trying to distract my brain from doing that it feels weird like I have a body suit which is shrinking and crushed me. I just wanna get into the least amount of space I can and just, idk, dissappear, like just not there, was never there.
Sorry if I don't make any sense."
"Fuck me, I'm so tired of pretending.","This is so me, but i only do that to get acceptance from people.. my survival strategy"
Somebody noticed I am not ok,It's good to have moments like that with someone isn't it.
I don't want to kill myself but I just wish there was a way to stop existing.,Only reason I don’t kill myself is because of the negative connotation about it I don’t want a fucking pity party
Do you ever feel guilty that your parents got stuck with such an incompetent failure?,Most of my cousins are/were honor students and participated in a lot of extra curricular activities. One of them just got a scholarship. I dropped out of high school in 12th grade (yeah my grades were that bad) and I work a part time job at a grocery store at 21. I’m riddled with depression and anxiety and I can’t even act normal around my mom. How can I when I know how much stress I cause her 
"Today I brushed my teeth, took, a shower, exercised, vacuumed, played with my cat, stayed hydrated, and read a book.",Today you looked after yourself. Self care is important. You are worth looking after. 
You ever wonder if your just faking it,"Yeah I often feel like I’m just being lazy and sad and dramatic, playing the victim, and that I just “need to get over it,” “just move on,” you know. Heck maybe I am honestly. I don’t know."
I see why people don't open up now.,"Opening up to someone outside of the internet is risky bc irl people have an obligation to you if they accept the burden of your problems. Internet people dont have a real responsibility and can just help when they feel like it. I can understand why someone would want to leave after realizing the potential for a burdened relationship, but that doesn't make it suck any less."
I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time.,"...it is at times when I have been made to feel the least important due to external influences, that I am forced to turn inward and try to repair some of my own self-importance.

i know how hard it is to not have someone with which to speak."
i hate having to put away my feelings for 8 hours a day,"The funny/confusing thing is, people, doctors, motivators say change your attitude  and mindset and you’ll get out of the funk you’re in but all I end up doing is faking it like everyone else on this thread in the slightest hope that it might make me happier."
Does anyone else feel like depression and anxiety ruined all their potential?,"Before puberty I considered myself the main character of this video game, a leg up in this life without being arrogant about it and a bright future and the power to save the world. After puberty, depression hit me hard and hasn't let go yet. It feels like an outside pressure imposed specifically to snuff out the light of my spirit. Where I could've been a hero to someone, *anyone*, but now any slight challenge or aggravation fills me with an irrational despair that causes urges toward committing aggravated suicide. 

So now all my energy is spent fighting that urge and I am exhausted to the point that I feel myself disappearing and I am hollow. I'm left with the suspicion that this is all someones intention somehow.

Edit: Auto correct correction(s)"
Depression has made me dumber.,Yes. at first I thought it was temporary but it shows in my work :(
I CAN’T DO ANYTHING,Numbness is the worst. My heart feels like it's dying all the time. I have lost my sanity so many times. I drive home screaming in the windshield it can be that bad some days.
"""I think the saddest people always try to make everyone happy because they know what it is like to feel worthless and don't want anyone else to ever feel like that""",What about us sad people who are too damned socially anxious to be able to try to make others happy?
I just want to sit on a rooftop at 2am and talk about life with somebody.,I would absolutely love that. 
"Depression is having no drive, purpose, passion, or commitment",I know exactly how you feel dude. Been out of work for what feels like a life time. I've tried hobby after hobby. Wasted money nothing Ive stuck to. Because I stop enjoying it. Then I'm filled with guilt. I eat through too many feelings. But have no drive to change it. I tried volunteering but I stopped wanting to go out. When will anything ever fit?
I feel like my depression and anxiety has prevented me from reaching my true potential,"It's good that you have potential in mind, because having some kind of focus was essential, at least to me, to get my mind on babystepping towards something and trying to reach that summit. My goal was just to get a girlfriend (shallow but it worked), but it did kick me in the butt and get me to social situations that terrified me so I could practice convos.

Is there anything you wanted to do with your life, or a person you wanted to be? Are there any particular steps between where you are now and where they are that seems insurmountable?"
These random spikes of happiness and hope really fuck you up after. Nothing matters now.,Yeah actually. When i become happy i know that in a couple minutes i'll get either depressed or pissed.
I miss the person I used to be,"That sounds exactly like me, I have no idea how did I mess my life up 😭"
I got my degree!!!,Congratulations!! 🥳 That's awesome 😊
Do you ever want a intimate relationship but know how fucked up you are so you just dont try?,"This is me right now. There is somebody that I like SOO much, but I’m avoiding trying anything because I know how fucked I am in the head."
"Theres a part of me that wants to get better, but theres also a part of me that doesnt","If my experience is any indication, the things pushing you to better yourself are wanting to rid yourself of the pain, wanting to get stronger or more grounded to chase your goals, or to stop hurting anyone you hurt through the problems. Wanting to stay the same is a result of depression itself sabotaging your mental and physical efforts to change, not having an idea of who you want to be or what you want to do so you choose the devil you know (depression), and a desire for self-punishment."
You know something's wrong when you can't even muster the strength to play a fucking video game.,"My partner got a GameInformer in the mail today. I should have been excited to read about the new Resident Evil or the indie games I would find intriguing. Instead I just stopped being able to take in the information a paragraph and a half in.

I used to be interested in programming. Reading fiction. I normally have dozens of ideas I can't possibly do anything with. Lately I just listlessly hang around the apartment and go to work to my terrible job. 

Right there with you."
anyone else ugly as fuck and wanna die?,"Yup being born ugly sucks.  I’m trying to improve myself but it’s hard to not go what’s the point sometimes.

Bad acne scarring too."
Today was my 21st birthday,Happy Birthday! I hope this is a milestone of your impending greatness.
Anyone else feel like they've lost their identity?,"From my experience sleeping in and not getting out much are quite conducive to depression. Try getting up early every day, maybe getting dressed and going to a diner/coffee shop/Dunkin/Starbucks/McDonald's (dont know whats around you) and reading the morning paper, have a cup of coffee. Start there. Then introduce some variation to your routine. Sounds trivial but often the smallest efforts to break out of your shell make all the difference with depression."
Anyone else wake up and mad they woke up?,"Every. Single. Day. I'm like "" oh I didn't die in my sleep huh, well fuck"""
I don’t want to kill myself but I don’t want to live.,"You’ve described my entire existence perfectly. I’ve always struggled with depression over the years, but as of late it’s been increasingly high. I tell myself I could never physically end my life, but it sounds so damn appealing to have all of the problems and negative thoughts vanish. That’s why I sleep a lot when I’m depressed, hoping I somehow remain stuck in that weightless dream like state."
"In your experience, is it common to dismiss your depression as just being a bad person?",Yes; this is one of the more insidious things about depression: it makes you think you don't have it and/or don't deserve help :( . It's lying to you
I wanna stay depressed,"I kind of understand what you mean.  I guess we are depressed so much it becomes familiar, almost comfortable in a way.  I get it."
Do you ever wish you would accidentally die?,"I thought about it and I'll be honest: I constantly wish I never *existed*, but regardless of how I die, my parents will be grief-stricken and will probably cease to function.

I've just resigned myself to being stuck in this shitty life for a few more decades, and it's soul-crushing."
"Does hearing ""college is the best time of your life"" or ""enjoy being young while it lasts"" freak anyone else out?","It freaks me out because I recall being miserable in college, unable to make lasting friends. And now that I am going through young adulthood, and already feeling how shitty it is, and knowing it only gets worse, makes me not want to be here for it. To think all this time I've been considered healthy, even though I'm really not, that it inevitably gets much  worse."
I want to be left alone but don’t want to be alone?,"Dont be ashamed of the way you feel. It can be difficult to explain to people and it might seem like you are pushing them away, but try to tell them the same thing youre saying here. Good friends will accept you and be there for you even when you want to be alone."
"Today I got a haircut, shaved, cleaned up my desk and walked the dog",So proud of you! <3
So sick of hearing “you need to go out” and “put in some effort”,Also tired of being alone. I've started just going out and buying coffee or something once per day just for the human interaction.
You wanna know the worst thing about depression (to me),"Everyone tells me to think about my future and my dreams and how life can be. But my depression tells me that I will never be able to do any good. I won’t be able to reach my goals and I don’t even deserve it because I’m just lazy and don’t even try. 
I have so many dreams but no faith that I will ever get there"
I desperately want to talk to someone about everything but I really don’t want to talk to anyone about anything.,"I feel you, I started drinking and the other night I drank a little to much and I started telling my friends everything and I wish they didn't hear any of it because now they are really worried about me.
"
Dae else feel depressed because everyone else your age is going out and living their life and you sit alone in your room every week,"yeah. also doesnt help my parents constantly remind me of this and tell me how much im wasting my life away, drowning myself alone in my room every day lol"
Regular Check-In Post,"I gave in to my depression and stayed home instead of going to an exam that made up 35% of my grade. Then I thought to myself what the fuck did I just do and I dragged my ass to office hours to beg for another chance and told my professor honestly why I didn't attend. 

He was very sympathetic and told me he could tell I was having a hard time and said I could take it tomorrow. I don't feel like I deserve this chance, but I won't waste it."
whenever I have to do anything stressful I briefly consider that I could just kill myself instead,This defines every second of every day for me. Its to the point where i end up just doing nothing instead which makes me want to kill myself even more
Prison without fucking walls, I hear you. It can be the worst feeling. Stuck.
You ever just run out of social energy?,Dude ran out of that energy like two weeks ago and still haven’t refueled. Sitting alone comfortably.
I wish I could donate my remaining years,"I feel you 100%. I wish I could give my time and whatever is still good in my body to people with terminal illness or disabilities. People who love life and wish for more time, but have had fate cut their life short. How do I deserve to live when my routine of hating my life and wishing I would die is a spit in the face to all those who would give anything for more time here? I have wasted my health and purposely damaged it when there are people confined to wheelchairs or with brain damage who would use it for so much more."
Anyone else feels like they are annoying everyone?,"This describes me. I’ve only told 2 people about my depressing thoughts, and suicidal thoughts. I want to talk to my best friend (1 of the people that know) but I always feel like I’m annoying her. She has a life why should I intervene in her happiness. I feel like a screw up most of the time. I can never do anything right and it makes me hate my self. Whenever I tell my mom something somehow I get in trouble for telling her it. It always ends up being my fault in a situation. What I’m trying to say is I know what it’s like. I’m sorry you have to go through that as well"
"Want to die, but don’t want to commit suicide",I think this all the time. How nice it would be to stop feeling.
"If isolation is bad, why does it feel so good?","Prolonged isolation will cause you to fear people even when they have your best intentions in mind. Your mind will see any sort of interaction as a threat and you'll go into the fight or flight response. Usually, flight is the preferred option, but if you find yourself picking fight in a situation where it's not needed, then you'll be in a whole new world of trouble. Think about how a stray or abandoned/abused dog is usually terrified when it's found, and it lashes out at the people trying to help it. It's important that no matter how isolated you feel, recognize that people in general aren't your enemy."
Reminder: NO ACTIVISM is allowed here at any time.,"Sorry if I'm stupid, but what's activism? I don't want to accidentally break the rules"
I really need a fucking hug.,"Can't tell you how much I feel the same way. I'm crying on my own right now.

Many internet hugs to you 💙"
Anyone else just super tired all the time,"All. The. Time.  


Have you been checked for sleep apnea?"
"After three months of almost crippling depression, I finally had the courage to call and make an appointment with a therapist and I'm very proud of myself :)",Its really refreshing to see some positive stories on this subreddit. I'm proud of you and I hope you can heal and gain a lot from this. :)
"""Depression is living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that tries to die.""","Or in my case, a mind that is already dead.  A mind that is too aware of its place in this world."
"I hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs.","You needed someone to empathize with you not try to relate it back to themselves. When we are hurting or down we need people to listen and be sympathetic, not turn it around on themselves. 

Many parents can only handle these situations by bringing it back to what they can relate to. 

They are trying but can’t see it from your side. Maybe explain to them what you want them to do. Listen and say, “I am sorry”"
You don't know how much depression affects you until you have a good day,Those days are the best! 
Do you also sometimes fool yourself into thinking you are not depressed anymore?,"I feel like i do not have a reason to be depressed anymore. I'm just stuck in an endless loop of things that happened in the past, and still believe they are happening today."
My dog just saw me crying on the back porch and started barking at random things.,"Take care of her. My dog died this January, and I am still devastated. He's been with me for 8 years, seeing the best and worst portions of my life from high school until I passed the national engineering license examination. Dogs are the best thing to have, even better than people to be honest. "
"Does anyone else, when they're in a really depressed mood, feel like they're just acting sad to get attention?","Yea but don’t let the people with regular brain chemistry see this. They’ll never let us live it down 

Edit: wow this is my very first silver."
Anyone else jealous of others happiness?,Same it literally kills me watching everyone succeeding and me just staying still or even regressing
I just wish I could be asleep for the rest of my life,I find it sad that I want to fall into a coma and never wake up. 
Does anyone else just wanna start new,I agree I don’t feel alive I want to get in a car and just drive anywhere but here. This place just reminds me of my sadness I don’t feel like I’m breathing here.
People who are depressed should reach out to their friends. *tries to reach out* Nobody replies.,"I know what you mean. I lost all my friends in the last 2-3 years. My cousins at family gatherings always tell me I can reach out to them for help or to hang out, but that's only to look good in front of their parents and relatives. 

They never answer my texts or just say they're busy."
Do you ever just hate the person you've become?,I don't even know who I am anymore.
I took my first shower alone.,Depression can be really crippling. Well done! This is a big milestone and a sign of great progress
I Hate when you feel slightly okay for a brief moment and your mind tells you that you must actually be a fraud and there's nothing wrong with you,"Depression is like that, likes to make you feel like you're over-reacting. Depression is an abusive relationship, it will gaslight you into thinking you're over-reacting, over-thinking, and being dramatic. Don't listen to it! I hope you enjoy the Foo Fighters concert, remember to be in the moment and just take each moment as it comes."
Why don't you talk to us?,"My response whenever somebody says that to me:
By that logic you could say I don’t have the right to be happy because there are people way better off than me. 

"
I have been self harm-free since February and I’m proud of my self for that bit it wasn’t easy.,"try using something healthy as a release of the emotions. crying, exercising, reaching out to a friend to vent, etc. you got this!"
I have no personality,I feel like this all the time. Sometimes I'll come across something I wrote when I was younger and it's like reading the diary of a cool stranger. Don't know where that person went. All I do now is react to things.
I have constant passive suicidal thoughts,"Oh the same is happening to me, i just didn't know how to call it. I have no plans of doing anything but the thought is constantly in my mind. Sometimes when I'm not thinking about my suicide, I'm thinking about other people's suicides, but in the end, the thought of suicide is always there."
An old man killed my only way of coping with depression and anxiety,"That's rough. I guess it's probably been a while now so might be too late but wonder if any businesses in the area might have had cameras or anything.

Not sure what they can do in court when it's a matter of one person's word versus another but I hope it gets straightened out.

Hell, if the guy won't give up the lie you could say you want nothing from him, you won't sue him, you just want him to admit so your insurance rates can go back down etc.

Sorry that a coward would lie like that."
"Does anybody else fantasize about just...disappearing? Like taking off to a far away place, cutting off all ties that you have, and just starting new?","I have been consumed with an idea like this for the past two months. In fact, I just spent 2 hours this morning (I am on short term leave from work) thinking about what I would do.

Honestly all I truly, truly want to do with my life since I was a child is just go to a country, or a few countries, and devote all my time and efforts to helping people who are less fortunate than I have been in my 24 years of life.

All I need is a bit of food to eat each day and somewhere to sleep. I will work wherever (does not matter as long as my life is not on the line) to make some money and all the rest of my time would be volunteering.

I am so utterly disgusted with the way I have lived in blissful entitlement, and just recently, self-sabatoging my career opportunities because i am so lazy and fearful. Everything tough has been done for me my entire life and all I did was become with comfortable with it and play video games all the time. 

I want to do everything I can to help the people who do not have the opportunities and life I have and who I know would fight with every ounce of their blood to keep if they did. Those are the people who deserve it. Those are the people and children I want to help. This also feels like the only way I can love myself as well; the only way I can truly feel happy. I can't stand being in business. 

I probably sound crazy too lol, but it has been consuming my mind and is the only thing that ignites any passion or fire in me now. "
I wish my mom hated me so I could kill myself without making anyone upset.,urrgh the guilt of hurting my family is the only thing holding me back
I’m fucking sick of my life but I’m too scared to die.,I wish I could trade my lifespan with someone who’s young and dying and actually WANTS to live.
I really hate when people invalidate a depression diagnosis as someone being lazy and etc.,"My dad is a huge trigger for me, he purposefully yells and towers over me to the point where I hyperventillate and panic and then my step-mother would come in and tell me i brought this on myself and that if I just prayed more that I would not be so depressing and people might actually like me. I have since moved out and I have never looked back, f\*ck anyone who says depression isn't real."
Anyone else feel like falling asleep and not waking up.,"I'm the same way. Plus, the idea of committing suicide is scary within itself. What if you fail? I was almost hospitalized because I opened up to my doctor about my suicidal thoughts, and I felt like a caged animal. It's the worst."
"The older I get, the more I realize I’m going nowhere in life and the more I hate myself.",I'm 40 now but when i was 20 at least i was naive enough to think theres hope but I'm in the same position 20 yrs later and i get super depress knowing that i'll be where i am now when I'm 60.  Hope I'm wrong.
Regular Check-In Post,"No offense, but really does anyone care?

I feel that if you aren't us, it is really ingrained into our society to ignore us, except if we are going to hurt ourselves or others. Somehow I make it to work everyday often ignoring hygiene for a few days, but I make it. Then I get to listen to inane drivel of co-workers and peers talking about ridiculous nonfactual points supporting their categorically wrong viewpoints. I have to keep my mouth shut, or else I have everyone around me saying I'm wrong, and I am rarely wrong. Shuffle day to day, keeping control because of multiple medications, knowing that my life is meaningless, and insignificant in all aspects but stuck in a ridiculous juxtaposition of significant anxiety and fear of death, clinging to my mortal coil regardless of all costs.

How can we have the imagination and the sentience to express ourselves linguistically, design elaborate systems, develop fiction and everything in between, but that it traps us in a grip of everything terrible we can imagine. What a curse it is to be human, to know what we do, and yet to not know enough in order to calm ourselves in this ridiculously turbulent universe. Less than a speck of nothing, we exist without purpose, and continue without reason.

&#x200B;

I am lost, depressed, fatigued, hurt, and yet I am still here. I don't have hope of being better. I live the day and make it to the next, and despite my pain, I will continue as long as I can."
Why do people tell me being alive is special? THIS is life. Mundane days like these from morning to evening until we die. There's no fucking transcendent spiritual bullshit crap. IT'S JUST FUCKING THIS!,"the worst part about it for me is that a lot of other people seem to have found something that makes life worth living, and we don’t have access to that. I don’t get excited or happy about anything, I have nothing to look forward to, but other people have things they like and hobbies they can keep up with and other things that make the days less boring, but everything for me is so painfully mundane."
I almost feel like I should’ve killed myself a long time ago and now I’m just living out a life that wasn’t meant to happen?,Man  I didn’t know how to explain this feeling I have been feeling but wow this one hit home
Anyone else feel like depression has made you dumb?,"Kind of. 
I feel it affected my memory. I started to forget a lot of things."
I no longer believe in the myth that any challenge can be overcome with hard work alone.,"The idea is not that hard work leads so success, it's that you can't succeed if you give up. It's not about avoiding failures, but about not letting failures discourage you. It's about the idea that if you stick around at the barber shop long enough you'll get your hair cut *eventually*, even if it turns out different than you expected. The question is if the thing that you want to have is *worth* the struggle. That's the difficult part for us depressed people. I don't feel like anything is worth it, especially not me."
I hate it when people say “well occupy yourself” when you’re depressed.,"Like the people that say “look at all the stuff you have, you should be grateful”"
Don’t want to sleep because tomorrow will come faster,"Yeah, kinda also why I don't want to go to sleep at night because that would mean waking up to another day"
I never understood why the suicide rates went up during Christmas time... now I do.,"""Suicides peak at Christmas"" is just an urban legend.  Suicides peak in mid Spring in both the northern and southern hemispheres, coinciding with the lifting of seasonal depression, and, believe it or not, thought to be related.

Nevertheless, we know that many of our community find the holiday season brutally difficult."
I don’t want to kill myself but sometimes I want to stop existing.,Sleeps the closest you can get. Free trial of death
If I knew what I know now I would've just killed myself when I was 14,"I did try to kill my myself when I was 14. I failed. If I knew then what I know now, I would’ve gone to college far from my parents, gotten treated for depression, and realized that my weight does not define my self-worth and confidence in spite of what my mother says.   

Now I’m 48 and content. I’m happiest when I’m helping  animals at the rescue shelter.  I’m probably an oddball to many but I don’t care."
Anyone feel like years of their life are like a blur due to depression?,"Yes, the last I remember, I was 22 years old and the world was at my fingertips. Now, I'm 30 and I don't know how I got here. All I can remember about the last 8 years is sadness, pain, and losing myself."
Feels like my only passion is just not having depression one day. What a waste of life.,"29F and same. I don't care at all about my old goals and making new ones just seems pointless. I simply won't care about them.

I try doing different hobbies etc but it's just something I could take or leave. I tried going on a date, it wasnt good for various reasons but a main one being I just felt nothing."
"Sometimes while enjoying time with my friends, all of a sudden I get very down and feel like crap. Over basically nothing. How do I get over this?",It's kind of like you're actually have a good time for once but then suddenly your brain reminds you that your life is still generally shit.
"""The loneliest moment in someone's life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly."" -- F. Scott Fitzgerald","A little inspiring quote by Hemingway:

We're all broken; that's how the light gets in."
“you look depressed” thanks it’s the depression,[deleted]
Does anyone else feel like they only staying alive for other people,"NEVER SAY “I shouldn’t have depression.”
We can’t control the way our brain acts sometimes, only try to adapt to it. You are not selfish for thinking of suicide and there’s nothing wrong with being depressed.
Not reaching out to your family is killing you man, if they care about you enough that they’re one of the main reasons you’re still here, trust me, they will be your number 1 ally in batting depression.
You got this brother"
Every time you open up about depression people always feel the need to invalidate it,"that's why I like this sub, I've rarely seen that here"
"12 months ago, I tried to kill myself. 3 seconds, that’s how long the EMT says I was gone for.. My body is suddenly getting flashbacks to that moment and it hurts.",What lead to the suicide attempt? I'm pretty desperate right now. My brain feels fried. I have to change my meds asap and I'm a bit worried about it. I don't want to gain weight. I know that's probably nothing compared the torment your going through.
does anyone else wish they could die from an outside cause,"This is called ""passive"" suicidal ideation. I dealt with it myself quite frequently before I began actively contemplating ending it. It hurts so bad to want to die, even when we just don't want to hurt anyone by suicide."
"I need constant background noise (youtube, watching series) because I'm afraid of being alone with my own thoughts. Going to sleep is scary because I don't know how I'll feel in the morning.","It's uncanny how much I relate to this. If you have good YouTube channels, feel free to share. I can list some of the channels I watch for this too."
I don't feel like I have any genuine friendships or relationships with anyone anymore.,"Fucking same. I just feel sad sometimes but I’ve accepted that I’ll never make friends. The worst thing is that up until a couple of months ago, I had five super-close friends and we’d do everything together and hang out all the time. This is gonna sound dramatic but I remember being able to relate to “me and the boys” memes. Now I’ve just given up."
My parents just yelled at me for 2 hours.,"Blaming you that your father may have a stroke?! That's beyond fucked, excuse my wording. You have no fault in this, your parents are idiots, they may have problems but this isn't something to blame you. I can imagine how bad it feels and I think it's better to try ignore them and focus on yourself.
How old are you btw?"
Depression feels like a perpetual homesickness while simultaneously not knowing where/what home is.,"I like your explanation

Home is where the heart is.

Easy to feel homesick when you don't know where your heart went or if it's coming back.
"
I really wish I could kill myself before the new year so I don't have to deal with whatever misery 2020 is going to bring,"December is an awful awful month, and if you complain about family then people shame you because at least you have one, right?

I can’t wait for the fuckin holidays to be over OP, I hope you’re able to find some peace in january"
i wish i could restart my life,I’m there with you but wishing it were different for us both. Hang in there.
The most depressing part about turning 30 is when you start thinking “this really is my life after all”,"That's me now and I'm 40. See things coming but do it anyway, have leaps of faith, put your trust in the wrong people, entrap yourself in poor decisions and spend the rest of your life looking in the rear view mirror. What if becomes constant company. Sucks."
Does nostalgia bring up your depression?,Yeah I know what you mean. I think of nice memories from the past and see how it will never be like that again :(
Does anyone else feel like there is a fog in their head they can't get rid of?,"I used to be a person who is NEVER late from anything, good at school and overall had good focus. Now I can't focus at school. Ive been late a lot and missed classes. In fact I quit my studies. I just don't really care, but it just gives me more anxiety when I actually realize I'm late when it's really not part of who I am at all."
Having friends and family that don't understand depression is awful,"It feels especially hard to put on a happy face every time you’re with people, but sometimes, you just can’t explain to other people what the other side is like. And I think we all have to accept that so we can move on from these wretched thoughts. 

It’s not easy turning off the part of your brain that’s always skeptical and judgmental to your every moves, but that’s the fight. We gotta win from within to show on the outside. And don’t worry about how others perceive you. There came a point where I realized folks don’t spend an extra second thinking about me, so why did I spend so much time trying to appease them? And once I became clear with myself on that note, I found myself to be much happier. No longer was I concerned with others, but myself. 

Just accept that, sometimes, people can’t understand the struggles of fighting this hopelessness daily with each new breath, but you can be sure that if you be open with yourself about fighting those negative thoughts, they will be supportive."
I've told 2 college professors that I am suicidal in less than 3 days of each other and..,That's really good to hear that there are people in this world who know how to talk about it without freaking the eff out or invalidating people. Glad you have those people in your life.
This is not the life I imagined for myself,"Yeah same. I'm 31 got bullied a lot in school, outside of school too. And after some light fb stalking, all the popular kids are still living the dream, great jobs, travelling, loads of friends. Agreed, not like the movies at all :(

Thank you for all your replies, really means a lot :)"
My Wife and 2 infant daughters were killed this morning in a car crash.,"My daughter died in January of 2014. I spent most of the next year and a half wanting to die. It hurt so much that I felt that death was preferable to the pain. The thing that kept me alive, honestly, was that I didn't want my own death to overshadow her memory. That was all. I wanted people to remember her courage and bravery, and not have my suicide added to her story. Over time, the pain shifted in a way that let me breathe just a little. It's hard. Every day is so hard. I won't lie to you. I'd give my life for hers in an instant. But think of your own mother. She just lost her grandbabies. What would it do to her to lose you too? Who will tell their story, who will tell your wife's mother how beautiful she looked the moment you asked her to marry you? Only you can. Their stories are yours now, and you have the key to keeping those memories alive. To creating their legacy. That's not enough to rebuild your own life. But it can be enough for today, and for tomorrow. OP, I know you are in soul crushing pain. You are going to be for a long time to come. But you can survive. You can build something worth surviving for. "
"I've been left out of everything, and someone actually cared.","What an absolute legend, this man. He deserves orange arrows. Serious note though, you're one lucky duck to have people looking out for you like that."
I hate it when people criticize me for not doing enough because of my depression. I am literally trying my hardest. This is my best right now. Stop comparing me to someone with perfect brain chemistry. I'm doing all I can. This is going to have to be enough for you because it's barely enough for me.,"I hate how everyone always acts like I'm not even trying. I *am* trying. I'm trying *really fucking hard* and **failing miserably**. I'm just not cut out for this whole ""life"" thing. I just can't do it. The motivation to do anything worthwhile at all just isn't there. I don't know how long I can keep this up honestly. I remember being told all the time in high school ""boy if you think this is hard just wait until you're in the real world"" and now I'm here and it fucking blows, I don't want to do it anymore. Why do people not want to die? It makes no sense to me how non-depressed people just suffer through shit and it doesn't even bother them, they still have hope and ambition and shit, I'm not doing jack shit and I can barely make it to the end of each day. Maybe I'm just a weak fucking person. If natural selection had its way people like me just wouldn't survive. Why am I not allowed to just end it now? Why must I keep going even though I sincerely do not want to?"
Does anyone else actually want to talk about your depression with a loved one but then convince yourself that you’re just an attention seeking piece of shit that doesn’t actually have depression at all?,"Even though I have been put in a psych ward for a suicide attempt, I still feel this way. I never reach out for help because I don’t want people to think I’m using my depression to get attention or as an excuse for not performing well at work or school."
do you stay in bed for the whole day because you have no motivation or energy to do anything productive and then you start feeling guilty because you're not doing anything productive,"Feedback loop from hell. 

But you don't have enough energy for death, so you just chill and pray to a god you kind of sort of don't really believe in and ask for deliverance? Definitely have days like that, lol. "
"*cries to self* ""I need help."" *few hours later* ""What the fuck was I crying about anyway? *scenario repeats in a later unknown time*",[deleted]
Do you ever feel like depression set you back a few years?,"I dunno if depression set me back or if I am just an aimless loser. I have had very little growth since high school, I didn't have a lot of growth before that. I'm basically emotionally stunted with the maturity and desires of a 10 year old."
Anyone else wish they could hit the reset button?,every single day
The saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what its like to feel absolutely worthless and they dont want anyone to feel like that.,"This is mostly true, up to a certain point were depression stops you from being nice. "
Depression for me is the constant feeling that everyone else is better off without me.,"I always feel like I'm a sponge, I suck the life out of everyone and everything"
Depression makes everyday feel like groundhog day,Honest to goodness it feels being stuck in hibernation/low-power mode.
"Does anybody else notice that they are becoming increasingly bitter as time goes by, but they can't help it?",Yeah I hate everyone and everything annoys the fuck out of me. I’m angry all the time. 
I just wanna fucking die already. I didn’t ask to be here.,I feel this post. I feel like every move I make the ice is just crackin' underneath my feet. Like I feel like I'm driving myself insane trying to piece myself together. But what if my puzzle has missing parts? Maybe I don't have a point I'm just destined to be lost forever. A depressed wanderer with no home.
Taking care of the most basic things when your depressed is difficult,"I know what you mean. Sometimes, I only bathe once a week. Polar opposite of how I used to be"
I just went from a straight A student all my life to a straight F student and I still don’t know if I’m faking my depression,"I'm doing 2 fucking units this semester, and I have so much free time as a result, instead of being productive I just sleep all day and browse reddit all night, if I somehow manage to pass these 2 units it'll be just barely. Fuck this is supposed to be my last semester technically but with all the units i've failed already and the ones I straight up didn't enrol in (units where I have to do placements, I get anxious thinking about it so I guess I was too scared to enrol), I'll probably be at uni for another 2 years, If I don't just dop out and kill myself. And I used to be a decent student back in high school and early university.

On the one hand, I know my mental health is fucked, and is to blame for my shitty situation, but on the other, I feel like I just tell myself that because it gives me an excuse for why I am the pathetic piece of trash that I am."
I drew a comic about my experience with depression.,"Wow, that's poignant and lovely. Totally captures the experience. Thanks for posting it."
"Anyone else afraid of appearing ""happy"" in front of family/friends in fear that they won't take your depression seriously?",I do the opposite. I pretend to be happy and where the metaphorical mask all the time to seem okay. And I'm not. So everyone that knows I'm depressed doesn't think it's as bad as it is. I started to do this because I didn't tell my family for 5 years and only told them about a couple months ago. So I still haven't let go of the mask. Resulting in my mom thinking i'm not that bad.
Does anyone else wake up feeling fine for about 5 minutes before anxiety and depression take over?,"Honestly, not even that. Most days, the moment I wake up, the first thought is wishing I didn't."
"I enjoy being alone, but hate feeling lonely.","Same, I don't mind being lonely. But I wish if I could be lonely with just one single person. All I ever needed is, for a single person to care, to be in love with and be loved by that person, be wanted. I asked for too much, so I got nothing. "
A friend told my teacher that I want to kill myself. Now I'm in an even bigger mess,"A similar thing happened when I was at school. I got into trouble... INTO TROUBLE... for self-harming. Had a teacher shout at me. ""Friends"" against me, etc. That is no way to treat a person that's in a great deal of pain.  They need to examine their behaviour.

It's not your fault and no-one should be acting angry towards you when you need support. They are most likely acting angry out of concern and because they're unable to control the situation... which is in a totally roundabout way. 

Anyway, from experience of dealing with major depression, anxiety, self-harm, eating disorders and other people acting like absolute clueless idiots, what I can say is... You will come out of this stronger than any of them, with a great depth of understanding and emotional intelligence. More than any of them are capable of.  The world needs people like you, with sensitivity and real feelings... people like us. I truly understand, hang on please, friend. You are needed."
"""your problem is that you don't socialize""","""You need to go out more, it will help"" you always get that kind of thing from someone who has never been through it."
I. Really. Hate. How. It. Come. And. Goes. In. Waves.,I feel this too. I feel perfectly alright and the smallest of things could go wrong and it sets off a trigger somewhere and suddenly I'm once again thinking of everything that went wrong and could go wrong and drowning in a downward spiral already...
I had a friend over for the first time in two years today,im super proud of you :)
Open letter to my son,"Absolutely beautiful. Now, did you tell **him** this?"
does anyone else actually WANT to do something productive but you have no energy because you are so tired and lazy and unmotivated that you can't bring yourself to do it?,Every day of my life.
I had a shower and brushed my teeth for the first time in 2 weeks today.,"I used to have pretty severe depression (though admittedly it felt more like grief after losing a loved one) and I've found that, even though I'll occasionally dip back into a funk every once in while, *self care has been one of the biggest ways to prevent any funk from stretching for too long.*

Shower everyday. Shave and/or shape your beard (or shave legs for  lady redditors). Brush and floss. Drink coffee in the morning (Harvard study showed drinking coffee can lower risk of suicide by 50%). And, since it seems you may be like me, as evidenced by your comment ""the pain felt good"", *start working out.* If you lean towards a masochistic depression like me, working out will be the best thing for you. When you're on mile 2 of a run and everything starts hurting, the pain will feel good. When you're sore as hell after lifting weights yesterday, the pain will feel good. When everyone is having cake and you eat a piece of grilled chicken instead, then look in the mirror and realize ""holy shit I've lost so much weight"" the pain will feel good. When you care about your appearance you're mitigating the things you can beat yourself up about; ""I look like a piece of shit"" is one the masochistic thoughts that is no longer applicable. The new masochism is the pain you put your body through, whether that's weightlifting, running, dieting, bulking and power lifting, or even trying to beat your PR on a swim. 

Check out r/fitness, r/bodybuilding, any of those sister sub reddits. Make that self care a habit, don't allow yourself to wallow until you've showered, shaved, and maybe gone for a run for the day. Only allow yourself to wallow afterwards. You'll start to notice the soreness replaces the wallowing; you still get to be masochistic, but at least you feel better about it. "
Anyone else feel like they just aren’t cut out for life?,"Yeah, I've felt that way since I was 10 or 11. It was first the nagging feeling that I was too sensitive and I'd never be anything. Now it is just the dull, empty reality."
Doesn't it fucking suck how you can be laughing and enjoying something but at the same time remain unbelievably sad the whole time.,"I feel that too. It's kind of like a brief glimmer of joy and laughter, only for your brain to remind you that you are worthless. It's like it's telling me that I don't deserve happiness. 

You're not alone. "
I tried to hang myself yesterday and they're talking about getting me into school in two days. F 13,"Definitely tell the doctor that you want to try new meds. There are SO MANY different types out there. I've been through three and am trying to change after years of success - I'm on a downward slide and need help. It's okay to admit you need help. I have MDD, diagnosed at 20, but lifelong sufferer. I will get better, but it does take work and helping hands."
My mom was killed two weeks ago.. I don't know what to do,"It might be too soon. Just take it easy for awhile. Be careful you don’t isolate yourself too much.

My condolences. I hope that you’re able to find some peace of mind soon. If you ever need to talk, I’m willing to listen. Stay strong, my friend."
"Does anybody else feel so calm during winter? Fuzzy socks, soft blankets, hot drinks, laying in ur bed....I feel like I almost have a spiritual connection w cold weather. My dream is to move to a small town and just escape from big cities and stress that's going on in them.",I get even more depressed dawg but at the same time winter nights give me that weird nice sad feeling
"I'm only living to see if I'll be happy one day, but I'm impatient.","Live moment to moment. I struggle with depression. And the only way I've found to feel happy is to live in the happy moments while they are happening. It's hard but I live for the sweet moments. Try to find one good thing that happened every day. You found a good parking space,found a seat on the bus, a penny on the street, or saw a rainbow, heard an awesome song, had a post that got you lots of karma, one small thing a day so you can tell yourself hey today wasn't so bad. It's hard so hard but it helps"
I just want a hug so badly it hurts,"It's not pathetic at all - you're not a dumba$$ for wanting a hug and feeling lonely. Human touch, physical contact, is so vital that it can derail someone's life quite easily. I know it's nowhere near the same thing, but here are some virtual hugs 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗. I'm so sorry that you've never hugged anyone before. 😰"
Alone and Abandoned on my birthday,Happy Birthday
I wish I could re-do my teenage years without my anxiety and depression,[deleted]
i feel like depression has made me less smart,"Yeah, I used to be thinking about stuff I like all the time, wrestling, movies or video games, whatever it was. 

These days I can barely muster enough energy to care or think about them. My mind is just either empty or drifts towards thoughts that make me feel like shit and I fucking hate it. "
It’s crazy to me that there are people out there who have never been depressed or thought about killing themselves,"I feel like many people confuse depression with sadness.
Whenever i told someone about my suicidal thougts everyone looked at me like i was mad or something"
"I did it guys! Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but I cleaned my house!","Man you're wrong, this IS a big deal, congrats for this ! cleaning and tidying your house is an important part of fighting, and certainly not the easiest"
"Just deleted a suicide note I wrote two years ago. I don't recognise the person in it, it's not me anymore :)","Dude thank you I needed this so much today thank you. A friend took her life last night and I spent the whole day with her family. When I attempted one of the main things going threw my head was now everybody else will feel like me, since then I don't want that for anybody EVER and after today I don't know how that though could get there. And now I'm crying. But in a good way for the first time today."
"Does anyone else feel like they want to die, but don’t actually want to kill themselves",All the time. Actually it's more like I want to stop existing but I don't want to die.
Anyone else thinks depression completely changed them as a person?,"I just stopped caring, stopped wanting to live essentially.

as is expected."
"Some people have sexual fantasies, I just fantasise about getting hugged and being shown basic affection and it never happens","Same, I imagine cuddling someone. "
"Do you ever just lie in bed, thinking how different your life COULD be and imagining all the possibilities instead of actually going out there and doing them?",Doing it rn. 
Does anyone else just think “kill yourself” every time you do something wrong?,[deleted]
Why does depression and anxiety make it so fucking hard to tell if people actually like you?,"I believe the term is Distorted Thinking. It takes many forms, but one is making assumptions without evidence. In addition, depression makes you see things in a negative light. This can lead to mistrust of other people and yourself. You assume that others aren't sincere, and you don't see yourself as worthy of their friendship either. 

The best way I've found to deal with this is to look at the evidence I do have. Maybe I have an awkward conversation with someone that makes me think they must hate me on the inside. But then I think back to past interactions and remember that they helped me out last week without me asking, and that's stronger evidence that they like me rather than an awkward conversation meaning they hate me."
I have no passion for anything anymore,"I'm in your boat, but people keep leaving me. My passion for the things I once loved is gone. It's the worst feeling ever. I hate being here."
I really miss feeling joy and euphoria,Childhood is when we were happy and didn’t know that
Sharing something I’m proud of for a chance,My ❤️ is happy reading this. I am proud of you too!
Anyone just want to take a break from life and just go to a park on a summer night and just look at the stars alone?,"I do it a lot. Even more than that I like to drive and listen to music at night.

I don’t really know many other people that like to do it, and a girl I really liked who used to like doing that to won’t talk to me anymore.

But it is what it is. I also like to lay on my floor and listen to music with low lighting on for example, a Friday night. I like it more than binging Netflix. Sucks it’s hard to find people who want to do it too... much more people that don’t have to talk all the time. Emphasis on all, I’m not that stuck up."
Nobody wants to deal with negative people,I feel this. Some people will wanna give you support and all but at the end of the day depressed people are no fun to be around and I understand that
Does anyone else feel their life won't go anywhere?,I know my life's going nowhere because that's what I've chosen. I've got absolutely no interest in participating in this groundhog day nightmare of slavery.
Depression has made me so stupid,You took the words right out of my own head.
"Two days ago I was feeling amazing, the best I ever have and now I am miserable and want to die. Wtf brain.","This happens to me do frequently its insane! I’ll spend a couple days at the pool with the kids, going to the library, running errands etc. Then I spend 3-5 days unable to get off the couch. It’s hard to get up and fix pb&js. I can’t for the life of me figure out how to stay in that space."
Does anyone else feel like they either can't or are afraid to speak up about their feelings because there are many people that have it worse and you feel like you shouldn't complain?,"yeah i usually question whether my problems are worth other people's time and effort to read it, or if it's soemtuing that i should deal with on my own. "
Daily cycle,TIL I'm depressed.
Dear God. Please make me not wake up tomorrow.,Honestly apart of me feels the same rn. I tend to contemplate life and I always keep thinking often what's the point really in the end. Why
I really don't want to die. I actually really like life. I just don't like my life.,"> I think the world is beautiful. There are so many amazing things to see and do, and seemingly countless possibilities, too many for a single lifetime.

Every day when I'm at work, I hear the birds singing outside and it breaks my heart I can't be out there with them. I have hobbles, I love animals, nature, and travel. But I don't have time to enjoy any of those things. I spend all day slaving away, earning just enough to continue my hollow existence. "

What if I don’t have depression and I’m just a lazy worthless useless human being who does absolutely nothing,"Damn dude I’ve been having literally these same exact thoughts, word-for-word.

My therapist committed suicide,"First, apologies, I tried to put this up yesterday but obviously it didn't get saved.   

***

Suicide is a particularly bad way to lose someone, and the therapist-client relationship is a particularly bad place to lose someone to suicide, so this is kind of a perfect storm of awful for you.  I'm so sorry.  

I've been a hotline responder IRL for a long time, and people sometimes ask me what kind of common factors I see in the people who end up at the brink of suicide.  For years I thought that I couldn't observe any because I (of necessity) I would get so immersed in each individual's situation and feelings that there was no room in my head for the big picture.  Eventually I realised that it's not that at all.  The big picture isn't what suicidal people have in common, because they have *nothing* in common.  The big picture factors are 100% about the person's situation and experience, not anything that's intrinsic to them.  

The harsh and terrifying truth anybody, absolutely *anybody*, can get pushed to the edge, including a person who has a real vocation for helping others as a therapist or a similar role. The world loses brilliant, sensitive, wise, insightful people to suicide every day, and although our understanding is improving (especially in the last 15 years or so), we still haven't reached the point where we can save them all and help everyone to get back to a state of vitality and engagement with life.  

Of course you need to let yourself grieve this awful loss; you can't just ""fill in the blank"" with a new therapist.  

> Like my symbol of recovery has been destroyed. 

Sometimes we lose valiant, strong fighters in the battle with the Dark Side.  But I don't think that's a reason to stop fighting.  I lost two of the most important people in my life to suicide, and both of them were mentors and role models to me.  Even though they lost the battle with their own despair, they both gave me things that I couldn't have survived without.  The way I honour their memory is fighting the mental-health Sith every way I can.  

You might find some help and useful information over at /r/SuicideBereavement, or in [the list of bereavement resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/i25yy/if_youve_lost_someone_to_suicide_here_are_some/) from the sidebar there and at /r/SuicideWatch.  "
"""How can you be depressed? You always seem to be happy.""",it's pretty common for people with depression to do that. I would highly advise you to tell your friend. I can tell you you won't be able to keep up the facade. If that person is a really good friend he/she will do anything to  get you out of your depression. Nobody wants to lose a person they care about. 
My girlfriend died,"The last paragraph is the attitude you need.
Stories like these are always exceptionally emotional, but even then the best thing to do is try to stay rational and realise that she is gone forever. I can imagine that you two had beautiful times together - instead of frowning upon having lost them, try to honour the time you had and do what you think would've made her proud. Which it seems like is what you are doing.

Wish you the best of luck, man. You deserve it.
Hope you don't understand this in a negative way, stay strong."
a man gave me this at the airport yesterday... he'll never know how much it means to me to know a stranger cares ,I'm agnostic but it's the thought that counts right. Nice to know there are a lot of empathetic people

"You ever want to explain how you're feeling on here, but then as you're typing it out you realize you can't even articulate your feelings, so you're just like ""eh, fuck it"" and continue to bottle things up?","yo! In my darkest time it was hard for me as well to articulate my feelings. Im quite rational and the feelings didnt make sense. Yet they were real. In the end I could only figure dhit out when I opened myself. 
So yeah wanna talk? maybe we can figure it out together."
Anyone else have semi-suicidal thoughts on a regular basis?,[deleted]
"I hate being alone, yet I want to be alone.","I've pushed almost all of my new friends I've made in my area away over the past couple of years.

I moved from my home town about six years ago for college, and during my first couple of years I made a lot of new friends. Life was great and everything was going the way I wanted!

About two years ago I started isolating myself because I wanted to be alone. It turned into me wanting to see my friends again, but I just wanted to stay inside. I don't know if it's because I don't want to see anyone I knew and loved, or if I think they don't want to be around me anymore. 

Instagram kills me to watch everything these old friends are doing because I think they are doing way cooler stuff with me out of the way. I feel like my life brings everyone else down. I'm starting therapy soon, I can't seem to be happy anymore. When I do feel happy, I don't know how long it will last."
We only see those who get better,"This is on of the reasons we don't allow role-modelling (which includes posting  ""success stories"" here).

They just don't help most people who are still struggling and constant exposure to them is just demolishing.  It's like making a starving person look at pictures of food.

That's just not what creates hope.  It mostly just creates more expectations to try and live up to."
All I want is not to wake up tomorrow,"I really understand this friend.. my heart hurts that you are feeling this. But i know what its like and the resentment fir those that get the release from this life. The only thing that keeps me here is being the mother of my beautiful daughter and amazing special needs son. Im only 28 but i am tired abd worn down, buti cant let myself give up. For them. I know its a heavy burden, but if you cant find a reason to live for yourself, find a reason for those you love.."
"Does anyone else just want to disappear? Not die, but just cease to exist?",For as far as I can remember I'd have moments where I wished I could just step back and watch the world. Like not have to participate and just disappear and watch.

Most people are uneducated about depression. I blame school, considering it's not even competent enough to recognize bullying."
"Depression will have you saying ""I'm tired"" cause ""I'm sad"" doesn't seem to explain how much it drains you.","There really is no sadness involved for me, it's just an all-consuming void of apathy that eats motivation and time and shits out incomplete assignments and missed deadlines. Sometimes it almost feels nice as I get too tired to remember what I was supposed to do and get to experience the feeling of being free, then as my mood picks up the realization of how much responsibility i'm ignoring hits and I'm back in the void."
Is anyone else afraid of opening up about their depression because it sounds needy or desperate?,Yes absolutely!! I have also dealt with everyone always telling me that I was just seeking attention when I did open up. Even when I was trying to hide everything from people and only shared because a part of me wanted to be alive. It is an awful feeling and I wish nobody else would ever feel it! The things going on with you are important and are worth people’s time. If anyone says otherwise it is their problem and not YOU. 
I miss the old me,"Hey! First off, let me say that you’re not alone and I know you feel like you’ve pushed people away/have no-one to talk to, but that’s not true at all. There’s people who care and love you. YOU. Your depression does not define you; depressionless you is not the “old you”, it’s just you in a different situation to where you are currently. How we manage and survive these situations are what defines us, not the situation itself. I know a stranger messaging online is no substitute for hearing from a friend or family, but you CAN do this, you GET through this. It’s all about taking each day as it comes - there’s going to be good and bad days, that’s all part of being human. The main steps are to seek help - are you on medication for your depression? Have you thought about counselling or CBT? It’s so easy to get caught in the negative and to be overwhelmed. Any small steps you can take will have big impacts in your recovery, and there’s no harm in asking for help. Here if you ever need to chat. I just know you get through this, don’t give up!"
What does a person even do all day?,"What helped for me is to have some routines. I walk outside for 1 hour every day, read 10 pages of a book and write something in my diary. I've created a mantra for when I don't feel like doing my routines. It goes ""you're not supposed to attach feelings to your routines, you do them, because they are good for you"". And then just act. It's not easy, but works for me most of the time. Progression keeps me sane.

Maybe try to limit the choices you have? Somtimes I feel overwhelmed with the possibilities. Have a list which has a couple of things you could do and choose from them. 

Depression is a bitch. Hang in there buddy!"
Anyone else feel like they're just scraping through each day to make it home and return to your vicious cycle habits?,"Yup, scrap the beer and replace it with weed, and that’s me. I mean I ain’t suicidal, just life has ceased to progress and I can’t get up for doing anything anymore. Hobbies, pursuing my dreams, all come a distant second when it comes to just being at home and stress free. Like you, I don’t know what to do to snap myself out of it. 

Sorry I can’t be of more help, wish I could. Just wanted to let you know you ain’t the only one just going through the motions day to day "
Who else envies people without depression?,"I mean who wouldn't feel envious. To be honest it makes me angry in some form, like if someone cheated in a competition and you're at a disadvantage."
"The question I hate most: ""Are you okay?""",this is so god damn relatable 
High functioning depression is so hard for people to understand,"I understand  what you mean. It feels like wearing a mask sometimes. You keep pushing forward to make others happy. You do what's expected. But nights you take off the mask. Or sometimes, it just weighs too heavy and you are forced to take it off. Sometimes it cracks. I believe in you. You are not alone. Keep pushing forward.

I had to fill out one of those depression tests today...,"Doctor: This is a really high score.

"DAE say ""I'm sick"" instead of ""I'm depressed"" because you know you won't get taken seriously otherwise?","Think it was near the ""get over yourself"" aisle at the local ""things will eventually work out"" mart, ya can't miss it. ^^^^^/s

But seriously people only ever get it when you take an extreme like suicide, and by then they can't do anything to make you better unless you somehow survive and possibly permanently disable yourself physically or mentally. All ages and all nationalities suffer from this, why is it still seen as ""oh no you're just feeling a little sad right now."""
"I never realized it, but I always used to try to make other people laugh and smile because I never wanted them to go through what I'm going through right now.","Yeah, Robin Williams said the same thing too.

I hate posting this shit on reddit because i know im going to get into an argument with some guy and he'll use it against me but yeah, in theory i should be someone whos able to thrive and create a decent life for themselves, but i just dont care anymore, years of being unable to create and maintain basic human relationships and social isolation kind of ruined me as a person.

Now it feels like a chore that I do because at least I’ll be distracted from all the shit in my head. Now I almost can’t take losing and take it so seriously because it’s something I do so often I can’t accept how terrible I do sometimes. "
I hate going to sleep because it means I have to wake up in the morning,"Me too! I always find it hard to describe to people, but I feel so much dread in the evening and will go on my phone or youtube for hours to put off going to sleep"
Does anyone ever feel physically too weak. Everyday I experience a rush of weakness or something. It’s hard to explain.,Is it like when you just get too tired in hiding or fighting the pain inside. And you lose energy like you just fought a 6 hr non stop war?
Attempted Suicide today. By stabbing myself so i can bleed to death,"Damn , i attempted suicide a month ago by cutting my hand ... i realised what i was doing when i saw my dog ... i was home alone and my doggo , who doesn t come up the stairs , came after it heard me crying in the corner of the bathroom . I love that fucking dog so much ..."
"I showered, brushed my teeth and shaved for the first time since June of 2016","There's really something about showers that somehow sparks hope in me. Idk. It's so therapeutic. When I'm in the shower, it feels like I can do anything again. Or I have all these set of plans to get back on my feet again. Sometimes when I shower I just don't want to get out. "
I genuinely don't have anyone anymore,"I can relate, loneliness really sucks"
I just want to be passionate about something again,"Feel that, all that keeps me going is the New animal crossing. What have you been trying out, just curious don't want to call you out or something."
I hate that I...,"I thought I was the only person. I just want to be the person that I was before, don’t you?"
My girlfriend died,"I'm gonna say something that someone else said to me when I lost a loved one.

I know now it feels like the world is moving on. I know you may be noticing people just going on, noticing how the world is just moving on without her, and that it seems unfair that the world isn't realizing what is missing.

The universe is a painting. everything in it, and everything that has been was a blop of paint on it. You may not notice the single dot from far away, and yeah there are bigger dots that people look at more.

But that painting, the universe, wouldn't be the same without that dot of paint, her. The universe will always remember her.

I'm sending you my thoughts."

"The worst thing isn't being alone, it's being surrounded by people and them making you feel alone.",[deleted]
Going into 2020 the same way I went into 2019,"I had a shitty 1999, 2009, and 2019. 2000 and 2010 were nice bounce-back years, and the hope that 2020 will be one as well is the only thing keeping me together right now. I’m not superstitious, but I need something to look forward to and this is all I have right now.

Find something, anything, to look forward to in the new year. It may not be a solution, but it may be a start."
Anyone tired of pretending you’re fine because not being fine makes others uncomfortable?,"I feel you. I wish I had just one person in real life, just one, with whom I could actually be myself and stop pretending to be okay cause I have not been okay for a long long time now and I'm so sick of pretending but I don't see any other choice. Talking is just gonna make things worse for me. "
Do y’all ever have those dreams where you wake up and you’re just so fucking empty because it wasn’t real.,"Those are the most vivid for me. It always takes me like 15 minutes to adjust my brain cause I wake up feeling like I've actually known the person that I dreamed up for years. 


The cool thing, I guess if you want to call it that, is that it's given me an idea of the type of person that I would like to date."
"I hate it when you’re so depressed that even your favorite music doesn’t interest you. Instead you’re trapped in your bed, in compete silence, listening to your brain talk shit to yourself","That is pretty bad,

And sometimes I'll try talking myself into reading a book and my brain basically says to fuck off and leave it alone.

Sometimes it's kinda like theres two sides to me, the one that wants to  be like those ""just do something you love and you'll feel better"" people to myself, and then the depressed side"
My family searched my room while I was in the hospital,[deleted]
"I'm smoking cigarettes and drinking beer so that I have something to do with my hands. I lost interest in music which always been my passion. I spent the last 5 days browsing Youtube, alone in my flat with hardly any news from my surroundings.",Yeah i used to enjoy the fuuuuuuck out of music now anytime i pick up a guitar i get sad and feel hopeless and worthless
It’s not fair.,"This is exactly how I feel. I see people going about their days enjoying things in relatively good moods and I don’t understand at all. Being conscious is all I can fit on my plate these days. How can you not just sit there and stew? How can you not freak the fuck out about how torturous life is? How can you take care of yourself completely and handle the weight of being sober? And then people tell you they care, but it just puts more of a distance between you and them. No one’s words can help. No one’s presence can help much either. It’s like a fire’s been burning in your mind for years and you can’t put it out but it hurts and you’re panicking and just ready to fucken end it."
Fuck all of this,"Same. Go to work. Come home, lay in bed. Repeat. Never talk to anyone. Never do anything. Get yelled at sometimes."
How do you guys find the motivation to do literally anything?,Honestly most of the time it feels like I could just be standing staring at a blank wall for hours and not realize. That's kinda how I feel most of the time. Dragged along. No real motivation of my own.
"Does anyone else just spend most of the day on YouTube,Reddit,twitter etc ?","Describes my life currently. It’s either wake up and go to class or wake up and go to work. Rinse & repeat everyday. When I’m not doing either of those things it’s a mix of Reddit/Netflix/Youtube. I honestly don’t even find video games to be as enjoyable as they were but it’s not like I could afford any new games anyway. 

I also nap, but I try not to because I’ll think “I can use that time for more productive things and if I stay awake now maybe I’ll actually be tired later and go to bed on time for a full nights rest.” Nope. That’s a lie I tell myself on a daily basis. I’m never very productive and I never go to sleep at a decent hour. 

This cycle is going to be the death of me. "
My wife died and now i'm a single father to 3 kids.,[removed]
I'm going anti-social slowly.,"I have the same feelings as you my friend, 5 years at college and 4 months on a job weren't the best times of my life, seeing how most people are inconsiderate towards how I feel and how it's always about them, and me being always helpful and polite, made me a defensive and not too friendly now a days, I won't be rude but I will just be taking my caution with new people until certain criteria is met (until I can trust them really).

You're not anti-social, it's everyone's right to feel sad when their friends don't support them.

also a side note, anti-social is different from asocial (you probably meant the latter), the former means someone who doesn't care about other's rights and thinks they can violate it whenever they want."
Who failed at 'everything' raise your hand,Slim Shitty standing up
I almost killed myself tonight,I also almost killed myself. I know exactly how you feel
my bed is my best friend,"Just like, staying in bed and doing nothing is sort of the most I can ""escape"" from life...the closest thing to not living, I guess. And that's not an option, so I have to make do 🤐"
"“You’re Mexican, depression is a white-people thing, we don’t have time for that”",Same shit from my Mexican parents but I think it might be a universal belief among immigrant parents seeing as they’re providing for and presenting their children with better lives than their own. Just my two cents. 
life is a chore,It is a chore. Specially when none of us asked to be here in first place and we have to put up with constant bs everyday..life is constant struggle and uphill battle
A stranger hugged me yesterday,People really can be wonderful! What an awesome story.
It pisses me off that people think happiness is a choice,"Sorry, we're locking this post because the supportive discussion has devolved into debate about matters way outside the scope of this subreddit.  "
"Slowly, I didn't realize I was already killing myself","Shit man, I hope you don't kill the writer because this was really well worded and structured, keep at it dude"
People are so keen to post on mental heath awareness day and on social media saying they want to help. But you can literally be crying in school/public and people will just stare at you and not do anything,"I hate that! My family does this. I told my dad that I have depression and anxiety. He laughed in my face and told me google invented depression. He said ""depression isn't real"" and other hurtful offensive things. That broke my heart because I wanted support...not a lecture about how mental health is a hoax and how the internet made it up. My step mom used to get angry at me and yell at me because I would lay in bed all day crying. She didn't understood that it was hard to get out of bed or even shower. She told me that I was lazy when in reality I was laying in bed thinking of ways to kill myself. As they yelled at me, I was in tears and felt I could do nothing right. A couple months ago, my step mom is posting on social media about depression and suicide on mental health awareness day. Yet, when I attempeted suicide and was in the hospital. No one visited or called me. I was called crazy and treated differently ever since and I could never forget being yelled at because I was depressed and ""not good enough"". People should stop using mental illness for likes on Facebook and instagram if they can't even support their own friends/family when they are suffering with mental illness. Thinking about this makes my blood boil..."
"Anybody else sick of the ""i feel the same"" you get everytime you try to discuss your depression with someone?","Love to hear my heart being given voice by you.

People suck at emotions. Sometimes I wonder if psychotherapists are the **only** people who understand how one listens."
"I achieved one goal in 2016. I started brushing my teeth. For the first time in 25 years of life, I brushed my teeth everyday for an entire month straight.","This is such a weird goal, but one I so relate to. I work in a professional setting, I'm decently presentable. But something about my depression just makes it so hard to brush my damn teeth. 

I'm so excited for you that you get to have this ""one small thing"". "
Is it just me or does depression make basic hygiene & waking up SUPER difficult?,It’s one of the symptoms I’m afraid. 
sometimes i dont care if i wake up again or not,I actually wish I don’t wake up again
"Can't because I'm depressed, depressed because I can't.","The second I read this heading I finally understood. Best way of putting the ""catch 22"" of depression into words."
Anybody wish they were 8 years old again and could start their life over.,Starting over is a nice thought but given another chance I'd probably fuck that up again too.
I don’t want to die,"I don't get why this is so difficult for people to get. Dying is a painful and cumbersome process, inexistence is eternal peace"
I’m so caught up in my web of depression that I sometimes forget that there are people out there who are content with their lives and want to keep living.,It’s strange to discover people don’t think like we do. I often think about being in car crashes a lot because I’ll either get money from suing or I’ll just die which to me sounds like the better option because money is fleeting.
You ever wish you didn't have any family so you wouldn't feel so bad about wanting to kill yourself,Family kept me hanging on too. You can get through it
I’m out,Wishing you all the best too.
Does anyone feel like they're just overreacting and destroying their life 'intentionally',"i feel this too but it’s not true. you’re genuinely at a disadvantage, physically and mentally, we have to acknowledge that. It’s not your fault. The reason why you just can’t do it is because of your illness, and if we all just had a victim mentality no one would be depressed would they? This is imposter syndrome at its best. But it shows you’re hopeful and that you want to be better so you’re already doing so well. It is good to criticise your behaviours sometimes but you have to remember you aren’t like neurotypical people so don’t hold yourself to an impossible standard. Remember its your life, you don’t have to live it like other people do anyway, so stop comparing yourself 😇"
Anyone have trouble planning for the future and being impulsive because you think you'll kill yourself eventually anyways?,"I honestly wasn't expecting to live to 24 but somehow I'm still here. I think the trick is to not plan for the future and take life hour by hour, day by day because things can change out of the blue. "
Anyone cry at the sight of normal families?,I feel you. Being deprived of affection is devastating.
Today I'm finally throwing away my suicide note,Good to hear! Cheers!
Sometimes I wish I could get killed so people wouldn't be mad that I killed myself. Has anyone else felt this way?,"Yeah, everyday. You want it that way because it wouldn't be a selfless act but more so an accident. Suicide isn't selfish but more so of a way of helplessness and just being fed up, however, that doesn't have to be the case, and well, people that do not struggle with daily suicidal thoughts don't understand.

What are you doing right now in your life that can be considered something positive? "
I feel alone when nobody texts me but when they do I just don't wanna answer.,"And then, after being ignored repeatedly nobody texts. It's a shitty cycle. "
There's people who don't have depression,And everyone feels sorry for them and wishes them to get better. I would take a broken leg any day of the week instead of this shit. 
Anyone else's depression made worse by the way the world is?,"That is basically the reason for my depression. Still not sure if I am actually depressed, but I have this constant anger for society and the way things are. I want time, money, so I can do things that I want to do. The world wouldn't be so bad then. Why does shit have to be like this? It never ends."
"Anyone else get up, get dressed, and then just sit and stare at the floor or wall for 30 minutes trying to figure out why you’re even bothering?","I do this all the time, I always get mad at myself when I waste time for no reason."
Does anyone else watch an ungodly amount of YouTube videos?,"Yes, yes I do."
Depression prevents you from doing the things you know will make you feel better.,"It sure does. The depression-anxiety combo is especially fun.

Depression sucks the joy and motivation out of everything, anxiety starts bringing up concerns of losing skills, depression concedes they're gone forever so why bother.

I also have this issue in which I stop indulging in pleasant things because I'm worried that I'll 'ruin' those things for myself. As in, I don't want to associate the pleasant thing with the awful feelings/whatever made me feel awful."
"I wish it were socially acceptable to tell your friends ""Hey, my life is super toxic right now and slowly killing me, can we hang out sometime?""","For what it's worth, I've started being this direct with people in my life. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't, but I feel better for having been direct, instead of tailoring my communication based on societal expectations. I'm personally happier, though my outlook on how freeing it is could most certainly be different than someone else seeing the times it doesn't work out as something to feed the depression. That's totally understandable and why results may vary. "
It’s 7am where I’m at and I’m about to go buy more alcohol,Welp it’s now 7:13 and I’m 15 beers richer

Do you guys ever quit typing your comment mid-sentence because you feel like your words aren't useful?,All the time.
"Depression stole my education, it stole all of my friends, my motivation, my dreams, my future, my life, me.","""Depression is the inability to construct a future."""
I’m tired of being tired all the time.,"I’m gonna schedule time with a therapist. Get a prescription going. Something is chemically wrong with me. I can feel it. My muscles hurt, stomach is always upset, I’m never horny, always sad. I almost don’t feel human anymore. I feel like I’m dying. 

I’m gonna go get a therapist. I need a psychiatrist, meds, something."
"I just miss the days when I’d wake up, get right out of bed, shower, then do whatever it was I wanted to do that day.",[deleted]
"Does anyone feel like they shouldn't be depressed because of how ""good"" their life is, and thinking about that makes you feel even worse?","For some time I've been thinking ""this is the time of my life - I have a good job, I've got money, my mother is still among us and doing pretty fine, I have some friends, go out sometimes, I'm not that old yet - why am I so unhappy then? It will only get worse."" 

Well I don't have a SO and never have had, and I'm pretty depressed about it, but still, one should be able enjoy life."
Finally going to Therapy.,Hey. Good luck for this. Hope you get better soon.
do you ever feel like you are manipulating people?,"I feel like that particularly after a bad depressive episode. I wonder if I'm a terrible person and that I'm making people feel bad for me cause I'm not really sick, just toxic. It's FUCKED up, to say the least. If it weren't for my husband I'd be convinced that I'm just toxic. Living with someone helped a lot since he's seen my episodes and my moods and when I'm really down versus when I'm okay and he reassures me that it's my depression and I know that now.. it just took some time."
Anyone waste time doing nothing?,"Yes, the constant switching between various kind of media, I do that too. Not even enjoying any of it, nothing interests me enough to finish it. Just using it to kill time. Sorry you're feeling bad :( "
"Today, I had my first session with my psychologist.","This was lovely to read and somewhat relatable. I hope you start to feel better. 

Oh, and Happy Birthday. :)"
"Woke up wanting to kill myself. Managed to go for a jog instead. Fuck you, depression!","Way to go partner.  One of my favorite sayings is **MOOD FOLLOWS BEHAVIOR**, and you just exemplified it perfectly.  I doubt you would be feeling as well had you crawled back into bed and pulled the covers over your head. Way to go.  Enjoy some gold!"
"Has anyone ever been eager, almost desperate to do something productive, but just so unmotivated to do so?","Yes sometimes when I have an idea I feel energetic but as soon as I start doing it, I know failure is waiting for me so I give up."
I just wanna cuddle with someone and cry while he/she tells me everything it's gonna be ok,[deleted]
Told girlfriend I'm suicidal and got kicked out,Your girlfriend is trying to kill You? Nothing makes sense about this situation. Unless the reason you waited so long to confide in her was because you knew shed freak out and literally do all the wrong things. Really sorry about your kid...
I just want to sleep forever.,[deleted]
How do people just accept working 40+ hours a week for the rest of their lives?,"My friend killed himself a few years ago alluding to this in his suicide note, I didn't quite get it until I started working. It's hell, especially with no goals, no real family, hardly any friends. 

It's hard to justify working yourself to death every day for the rest of your life if you'd rather just be dead."
Best part of the day is sleeping,"Already wishing I was asleep again, and I just woke up an hour ago"
I'm not fit for life.,Same tbh. And yet im still in college and failing. I just got zero marks for my first assignment. Such a waste of time here.
"You are a ""hero"" if you fight cancer and lose. You are ""disturbed"" if you fight depression and fail.","People ""battle"" cancer. It's something everyone in the family is usually told about. People fund raise. You're basically superhuman if you've achieved the title of ""cancer survivor"". You cheated death! People never say ""our family is battling depression at the moment"". It's a lonely disease. You deal with it on your own, or you beg for help. 

""Suicide survivor"" makes people very uncomfortable. You're no hero. Most people in my family have no clue about my situation regarding mental illness. No one mentions mental illness at the funeral (in my experience of losing friends to suicide). In the obituaries, it simply says ""passed away suddenly"". One of my dear friends had no obituary at all, no friends were invited to the funeral, she had no headstone or memorial. It was as if they wanted to pretend nothing happened. Like she never existed. "
Ever think you're over your depression but then it hits again?,"All the fucking time my friend. I feel ok for a few weeks, even happy for a little while, then I'm sucked back into this abyss and it gets worse and worse to the point that I lose the willpower to get out of bed.
 
For me it's stress that triggers it; even very tiny amount of stress can fuck me up very easily and that's even worse, because it makes me feel weak.
And yes, it's terrible and it feels like there will never be a time when I'm ok for more than a month, but it is what it is. We still get times when we can be happy and we have to work for happiness; it's not a default setting anymore."
Anyone else afraid 24/7 that they will end up a 30 year old fuckup living at home working weekends single with no friends? I am.,"Afraid?  That's closer to the truth than I'd care to admit.  Or at least that's what my mind tells me.  Not 30 quite yet though, so I could still fuck it up even more."

That's how I know those people who really doesn't give a fuck."
Labeled as mature for being apathetic,"This is so crazy to experience as a child because all my family talks about is how “easy” I was as a child because I never asked for anything, I never cried, I never showed emotion, I never did anything crazy like most kids I was so easy because I would be able to just sit in my room all day I never wanted to go do anything and looking back how did no one notice I was miserable? I hated being around people, I hated myself I had no drive and I had sever anxiety as a child so I never spoke up. I was flat, how is that good for a child?"
Anyone else in a zombie like state 24/7,"Yes, and when the way I am dawns on me, it momentarily terrifies me."
Do you ever feel like you are just 3rd-4th ranked option to people?,Yeah. Especially when you think you’re getting close to someone and going to hit best friend status only to realize they have closer friends than you and you will never hit best friend status with them. 
"I stay up late at night because I know the sooner I go to bed, the sooner I’ll wake up and have to start my day.",This....what I go through every single night.
Do you think depression has reduced your mental abilities and affected your decision making skills?,[deleted]
"Does anyone find themselves just going about their lives working, going to school, etc then suddenly overwhelmed by the misery of existence and want to run away and cry?","That's me! I can just be having a typical day sitting in class, and then the depression hits me like a punch to the stomach."
"Went for 2 AM walk in the rain, finally felt alive and free.",Rain sort of puts the pressure off. It's a license to not feel great. To me that's really liberating.
I really hate not taking interest in anything.,[deleted]
"Don't you love it when you're finally feeling okay and having a good time, and then a wave of loneliness washes over you, because you feel like everything you do is pointless, since there is no one to share it with","I hear you. Sometimes I'll be watching a good show, focused on a good game or into my workout, then suddenly my mind will race with all of this terrible shit going on and my drive to do anything is completely gone. My game will feel worthless, my workout stops, I can't focus on the show anymore. All I can feel is this lump in my stomach. It's really aggravating.. "
Anyone masturbate as means to deal with depression?,[removed]
I don't often see anyone mention the addictive nature of depression.,"Yes! There's this safe and familiar feeling and even though you know it's bad, it's your comfort zone. You can be alone and wallow in it. It's obviously very unhealthy but it feels right in a twisted way."
"I feel like as a child I didn't learn how to properly function as a person, and now I'm just a burden as an adult","Same here. No one taught me to stand up for myself so people walked all over me. I wasn't properly prepared for the adult world so when I graduated high school I had no known goals and felt like a waste of space. And I break down under pressure, even when it's not that intense of pressure. And that effects my job and my relationships and everything else. "
"Just because someone has it worse than you, doesn’t mean that your problems don’t matter","The worst thing that ever happened to you is a 10 on shitty things to happen, it's subjective and isn't a competition, I agree. "
Anyone else feel like they have to try and fight to survive because of their depression?,"Yeah. I'm the same, WINNING is just a way other people conceptualize it. Its not winning. Its surviving. Whatever the cause may be, its depression and it sucks. It takes over. Its a constant fight."
Started planning a road trip as an alternative to killing myself,"This definitely sounds like a nice alternative, sometimes just a change of location can make things easier for a bit, I hope it helps and I'd love to hear about how your trip goes"
"I just went from not leaving my room for 3 years with the biggest fear of going outside, to wanting to solo travel again! In 3 days.",Reading was somehow super cute and heart warming and I just wanna hug 😆

"Life in this society is such a catch 22. People are always saying ""reach out, if you ever need me"" but actually don't want to be near anyone depressed. They either deny it or downplay your depression if they find out. Or just outright see you completely differently.","Do you ever feel like people in your life don’t really care about your happiness, they just want you to get help so you’ll stop bumming them out? "
"In 8 days I have lost my job, my girlfriend left me and I’ve diagnosed with cancer.","Damn, man. I'm so sorry. Is there anything we can do to support you or help out? Are you going to be okay financially for now?"
I just don't do anything,"Yes, I can relate. I'm jobless because of depression and anxiety and alone at home, 24/7. 

I don't do anything either, just the basic things like showering, cooking, eating, Netflix, YouTube etc.

You (we) have to structure your days, maybe this can help a little. And you can set small goals like going for a walk every day for 30 minutes."
I'm so useless and do nothing all day.,...are you me? Same age same things happening. It sucks. I’m sorry you’re going through this too.
You ever just get so fucking sick of yourself?,I feel you. I get sick of failing at almost everything in my life.
I don’t want to kill myself because of the grief for others. Instead I wish I could just disappear and have nobody remember me.,"I know this feeling. Have thought this many times myself. So scared of the impact it will have on others. This seems like a torturous place to be, staying alive only for others feelings "
I finally told my parents I was struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts.,"A good response to ""what is so hard about your life that you are depressed and what to kill yourself?"" is the point out that part of depression is not having ""normal"" reactions to things and there is an irrational dissonance with reality and your perception of reality. If depression was simply having a tough life then it could easily be solved with more money/friends etc but it's clearly not."
"Don't you just hate it when some depressed people act like you don't get to be depressed because ""life isn't hard enough for you""?",I call that shit the victim Olympics.  Shit my feelings are real and I dont have to qualify anything with my brain before it decides to have them so why would I have to justify them to somebody else?  Those people are assholes and they think they are entitled to extra sympathy because of their circumstances and that somehow means you dont get to have real feelings because your life is different.  Some pretty intense mental gymnastics on that one.
"Nobody cares if you're happy or not, they just want you to function.",That's because they think functioning = happiness   
"Every night I think ""what the fuck am I doing with my life"" then wake up and do the same thing again",I feel you... I think about changing every day but it’s just the same thing. It’s never ending.

Anyone else's memory gotten really bad since having depression?,"Memory is a huge issue, but the absolute worst part of my 28 year battle is I can’t read anymore. I was a voracious reader, multiple genres, 2 or 3 books a week. But the last year, I can barely get through a page or two.  This might be the worst thing depression has done to me.  I’m heading into a remission, hope ready comes back."
Uncontrollable phrases?,"“i wanna die” just feels like it’s stuck on repeat sometimes, even if it’s completely random and not happening for any particular reason in that moment"
"I finally came out to my close friends that I have depression, and now I'm being alienated because I'm ""not mentally stable""",They’ve shown that they’re not true friends. Fuck them. Cut them out of your life - they’re not worth your time.
Does anyone else feel like their life has been irreversibly destroyed by mental illness?,"I know exactly what you mean. I've pretty much lost everything (career, hobbies, friends) due to depression and right now it takes all the energy I have not to give up completely. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because it would destroy my parents. I've tried over 20 different meds, a fuck-ton of various therapies and almost 30 electroconvulsive therapy treatments, and I still feel like this. I don't know what else to do. I feel doomed. "
What depression actually looks like.,"Waking up in the afternoon to sleep in the morning

Ignoring texts because you know nothing matters anymore

Sitting and staring at the wall isn't boring anymore

Sitting in a classroom trying too hard to not have a panic attack

Seeing your ex online and how it kills you the same every damn time

When someone asks ""how are you?"", you laugh because you know they'll never understand

Seeing your friends on instagram and feeling like a total stranger to them 

Being 21 but feeling like you are already 81
"
"Does anyone else get the feeling that everyone around you is living a fuller, happier, more complex life full of promise?",I feel the same way. Should've fucking died in my mother's womb
Anyone else casually want to die all the time?,Only when I'm awake

"I think the worst part of being depressed for so long is that not only do you start to believe it’s “who you are”, the people around you do as well.",I honestly don't know what my personality is without depression and I'm afraid to find out.
"Im going to a mental hospital and now I feel like ""Im not depressed enough.""","I work in a mental hospital. We have many patients like you, feeling like they don't deserve it. Sometimes they feel like they are taking away someone elses place who needs it even more. 

We see this pretty often when patients tend to have thoughts about harming themselfs. Its also some kind of selfharm to sabotage your own healing process. 

I bring up the idea of thirst sometimes when a patient talks about this specific problem. You are thirsty and you drink some nice orange juice. There might be a person who needs the orange juice more than you - but you are thirsty and the other person wouldn't profit from your thirst. You might want to share the orange juice. Thats why we have group therapy, to share the orange juice. Thats why we have wards for people with mental health problems, to share their problems, to learn from eachother."
Every time I wake up from sleeping I’m just like *sigh* “fuck.”,The first words out of my mouth every morning is “I fuckin hate my life”
Therapy just made me more aware of how isolated I feel because most people suck at empathy,[deleted]
I’m ugly and it’s been confirmed,I cant say much because I'm not sure what you look like personally but I definitely would say to not take any one persons opinion as word
I've showered every day for 5 days.,Self care is hard! Way to go and keep it up! 
"When I talk about myself, I feel selfish. When I ask others questions about themselves, I'm sad because they don't ask me questions back.","Yeah I've felt this my whole life. I genuinely care about other people and go out of my way to learn about them, yet no one wants to learn about me. Its probably the reason I don't value friendships and just want to be alone most of the time.
"
I’m going to kill myself,"I've had that feeling since about 6 years ago in college. Not a burning desire to do it, just kind of like an inevitability sometime in my life. For some reason I have this invasive thought that it'll be when I'm 29."
"I hate that time is passing so fast, and I'm still the same depressed shit.","I haven't progressed socially since about 17, which was 6 years ago now, I feel your pain, no changes, no love life, no friends etc"
Anyone else feel like they're just trying to survive rather than live life?,"Part of my depression has been getting stuck in survival mode- what do I have to accomplish before i can go back to bed? What's the bare minimum i can do to get by? Building long term plans requires hope, and that's in fairly short supply most of the time."
i can’t believe there’s barely 1 month left in 2017...time flies when your life is falling apart,Its weird how days can feel so so long but the years fly away by the blink of an eye. Sad story.
"If the moods of normal people fall between ""happy"" and ""sad"", the moods of depressed people fall between ""distracted"" and ""miserable"".",I'd say my mood falls mostly between null and undefined.
I am 58 M. Seems to be most subscribers are young.,"I'm 54 female. I have similar story. Successful, homeowner, great earner until 2009 when both parents died a week apart.
Had a breakdown and now I'm just ""being"". Cant really say I'm living.
Hope it gives you comfort theres someone else out here "
Why do non-depressed people think depression is about being sad all the time.,"Well I think a big part of it is how it’s largely shown to be that in film and entertainment. It’s like when people who don’t get high think weed makes you hallucinate, or inexperienced people do really cringe-worthy things when dating. They saw it on a movie and thought that it translated to real life. "
"Diagnosed with cancer, mom passed away, wife asking for a divorce. All within a few days.","Don't stop your routines that kept you healthy despite of depression, that is all how the downward spiral begins."
It's like I'm chronically lazy,"Yeah that is something I have battled with myself.
Finding the motivation to do things till completion. I do not enjoy or have the energy to do things that I do not want to do. I think that is an issue with high functioning depression. Usually it does get better and you are able to attach a reason that helps motivate you to see a task through to completion.
With academic and jobs in the past I had the mindset that:
 ""I will only be doing this for a year, it will suck for now but after a year I will be free and this will benefit me in the future"".
Thinking like that did help motivate me."
idk if this is just me,"Relatable, I mostly keep my mouth shut around friends and just appreciate being included in the goings on."
Does anyone else procrastinate till the last minute and then feel like shit for not doing things earlier,"It blows my mind that there are people who go through college and *don't* do that. I mean, I imagine there are people who don't do that. But the rest of us definitely do that, lol."
"I hate lying on bed all day, being unproductive........but it's the only thing I feel like doing......","Same. I laid in bed for about 4 hours just watching Bob Ross because I didn’t feel like doing anything else, but felt guilt-ridden because there’s plenty of housework that could be done. I’m also wasting my day off, even though all I want to do during the week is relax. "
February 22nd 2020,"This sounds all too familiar, you could’ve been describing my week. Creepy. 

But yes, it’s so tiring. That’s exactly how I’ve been describing how I feel about life lately: I’m tired of it. 

And I know you probably feel so empty right now, I feel the same. Just empty, and things that used to bring me joy no longer do. But I’ve gone through this before, so I know it doesn’t last forever. 

I saw a quote that was like “what you’re stressing about right now, you’ll be looking back at in 10 years time wondering why you were so stressed over it”. Obviously that’s not 100% factual lol but the issues you’re dealing with right now could very well be resolved or have disappeared in 10 years time. Nothing is permanent, we all have the power to overcome things, it’s about the journey to harnessing that power, and it’s a tough journey. 

You’ve gotten through all these experiences so far in your life, this is just another hurdle, life is long and there’ll be so many ups and downs, but if you wait it out, the memories you’ll make in the ups are so worth it.

I’m so happy you’re with us, as I said your words remind me of how I’d describe my own feelings, so it’s quite surreal, even down to overdosing last week. You’re not alone in this."
I’m a 14 yr old white girl diagnosed by a psychologist with depression,I understand. I'm a 14 year old white girl who has a lot of stuff mentally wrong. I'm constantly told that it's fake or it's just dumb. I get it. But you need to find some real friends who know you aren't lying.
I'm 36 and stuck in years of misery. Depression is my self identity now and I don't know how to change it. Planet earth literally seems pointless and I dont' know how billions of people can just live these meaningless lives.,I'm in the same boat.  34.  Lost all my friends years ago.  Haven't been in a relationship in years.  Even the ones I had were toxic as hell and they ghosted me after a few months.  Pretty much done
Anyone else feel that their best days are passing in front of their eyes?,I’m 20 and I feel this. I just waste time.
Depression leads to procrastination and procrastination to depression.,In fact I’m procrastinating right now at this very moment. Problem is i want to care about school work yet i just can’t bring myself to do it. 
Tried to draw how I'm feeling,"Phenomenal 

🤝"
Does 2018 seem like a blur to anyone else?,"Yup. 2018 was the year I was mostly on autopilot. Just living life as life dictates, while I lack the energy or motivation to thrive rather than live."
"Do you ever wonder if you are really just selfish, lazy and manipulative person who convinced youself that you're depressed to feel better about it?",[removed]
Anyone else get depressed simply over the fact that their own life is so boring and repetitive?,"I feel exactly like that everyday, I'm always listening to my colleagues at work talking about their weekends and the parties they went and I want that for me. Why am I not allowed to have that? My therapist told me to stop comparing myself to other people but I really don't think that wanting for friends, fun, and happiness is comparing myself to anyone. And the worst is when I try to change something like the way I dress or behave and fail miserably, sometimes I just feel like I don't deserve it and I just give up."
I socially isolate myself and then wonder why people don't ask to hang out.,for a second I saw the title and thought that I wrote this and forgot
I lost my personality.,Come join the robot club
Does anyone else just sit around and do nothing a lot of the time?,I’ve been doing that the whole summer. It’s crazy how fast it’s gone. I should be spending my teenage years making memories but instead I just sit inside. It sucks.
Has anyone else seen a significant drop in their IQ as a result of their mental illness?,Iv felt like my memory has gone pretty bad. 
"Depression feels more ""real"" - optimism feels like a delusion","This is an idea that I struggled with for a while, I hope you'll hear me out. There is a realm of thought (found it: [Depressive Realism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depressive_realism)) that states that depressed people are more realistic thinkers; they set more realistic goals, they have more realistic expectations, they see the world and themselves more realistically.

This is likely true to an extent. Optimism is often delusional by nature. But delusion is not necessarily a bad thing; in fact, it can be incredibly useful, as I'll elaborate below. And it's sure as shit better than lying: and while optimism maybe be delusional, depression can be a flat out lying motherfucker.

It's important to realize the impact of optimism vs. pessimism. A pessimistic person is less likely to set high expectations, or high standards. As a result, they are less likely to be disappointed. A pessimistic person is less likely to be step outside of their comfort zone. As a result, they are less likely to face failure.

Yet on the contrary, an optimistic person is more likely to attempt something that would be beyond their perceived abilities. As a result, they are more likely to succeed. An optimistic person is more likely to search beyond the bleakness of a current perceived state, and as a result is more likely to find happiness.

If delusion can fuel your well being, then what's wrong with giving into delusion? Many people call it confidence. Confidence is often just healthy, controlled delusional thinking. Confidence is choosing to press on despite failure and disappointment. Confidence is therefore strength; it takes a lot more effort to fight depression than to give into depression. But it's far more rewarding, and I think most would agree it's necessary.

Take a moment to separate pessimism from realism as well. Realism is the seeing of reality, in all its darkness as well as its light. Pessimism is the seeing of darkness and the giving into darkness. You can be a realist without being a pessimist.

So you have to ask yourself: do you want to be a pessimist, and simply wallow in the bleakness of depression for the sake of seeing the darkness in reality, or do you want to fight it with confidence and control? You can achieve a lot more than you think, including conquering depression.

Good journeys.


edit: edits. As a side note, depression is delusional as well. The article on Depressive Realism above confirms this: it's just delusional to the opposite means. There was a large campaign a while ago that simply said: ""Depression lies."" This statement has a lot of truth, and a lot of power.

edit 2 or so: Wow. Thank you all for your responses, negative and positive. I'm going to start losing track of conversations/debates here, so if I don't respond, feel free to PM.

probably final edit: Thanks for the gold, stranger! I had no idea this thing made bestof. Weird. Lots of issues with semantics going around that I'd love to clarify on, but my fingers hurt and I'm exhausted. One thing: I do not believe that depression is simply a choice, maybe that was unclear. It's very much a mental illness; but there are a lot more approaches to it than just Western medicine. If that works for you, great. If it doesn't, keep looking, there's always more options ([this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gdxry/depression_feels_more_real_optimism_feels_like_a/cak4ac9) offers some good advice on this)! Science is a vast, changing world.

psych, another one: [mkrccd provides](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gdxry/depression_feels_more_real_optimism_feels_like_a/cajwoy9) a bit more on the scientific side of this, for those of you looking.

Peace and love."
being alive is so exhausting,"it’s even worse when i remember when i used to feel happy and i don’t know how to get back there.

*edit: the upvotes mean more than you’d think."
Do you ever secretly wish for bad things to happen in your life so you feel justified to be depressed?,"I know that feeling. Then I remind myself: depression IS a bad thing in my life. A very bad thing. I hate feeling bad for having depression, but it's a natural thing to feel. Unfortunately, it takes time to get out of the rut your mind is in when one thinks about how they should be depressed for a reason. There is no reason. If there was, it wouldn't be called depression.

"suicide isnt the answer, but people shouldn't call it the coward's way out",Killing yourself is actually a really hard task and usually requires a lot of courage tbh.
No one showed. I should have expected that.,"I'm so sorry to hear about your story, honestly it just makes me hurt inside. I know it's hard but you wife seems like an amazing woman. It's an extremely rare phenomenon to meet a true soul mate, I wish the best for you bud"
Everything hurts,It's a cycle. There are highs and lows. You have to ride them both. I'm glad your family supports you.
I sold my guns.,"So proud of you, keep it up!"
Does anyone else’s depression make them feel dumb? Or...unable to focus on school work or semi difficult tasks?,"Yes, it makes my brain foggy. Sometimes I just sit there dumbly looking at my piece of paper and thinking 'why the fuck am I even bothering?'"
I disappointed everyone that expected great things from me,[removed]
"I am no longer a 21yo, unemployed, kissless virgin living with my parents!",Nobody's said it yet so Happy Birthday!
"I procrastinate because I'm depressed, and I'm depressed because I procrastinate","Today I received the news that I failed a life-altering, career-determining exam. I failed because I procrastinated, I procrastinated because I couldn't find any motivation, and my motivation was shit because I'm depressed. And now, the cycle restarts... "
"Anyone else find that, while you're super hard on yourself, you're almost too forgiving of others?",yes i also think that the dumbest things others do are things i would easily end up doing in their place
Casually suicidal?,"yeah, I don't actually plan on killing myself any time soon, but whenever something goes wrong I have this thought of basically 'or you could just kill yourself'"
"Does anybody sometimes hope they get sick, so they can die without having to use suicide and disappoint other people?",[deleted]
DAE feel like you're turning dumber as depression gets worse?,"Yep. I used to pretty smart. Fast forward a few years and I'm struggling through an electrical engineering program, have had to retake a couple of classes, and have like a 2.7 gpa. It isn't that the material is SO complicated, it's that my brain just refuses to hold on to any of the information, so I wind up spending three times as long on assignments as other people and still don't retain half of what they do. I can barely recall anecdotes about my life. I always forget everything."
Does anyone else live in their own head?,"Me all day everyday. I even pretend to talk with people with what I'm doing right now.

Example I'm watching T.V and I pretend to discuss the show with someone who is actually myself and my pretend friend.

Or when I edit photos/videos I pretend to teach someone as I edit. It keeps me happy but reality sets in."
"Why can't people understand I'm not just being lazy, I just feel unable to move",People don't understand how draining it is and how you just cannot get up. It's horrible 
Today I witnessed the most horrifying moment of my depression till date [TLDR: a TV repair guy kinda literally woke me up after 5 years.],"My memory is getting worse too. I don’t remember anything from 2016, all I know is that it was very painful."
Anyone else feel like they go through each day just waiting to go to bed?,[deleted]
I've thought about killing myself for so long I've forgotten that's supposed to be a red flag.,I dont do anything to improve my life because i always think I'll just kill myself in 3 years. Its been like 9 years now. Ughhh
You can never have an honest conversation about suicide,"There is a lot of misunderstanding about confidentiality and suicide.  In order for a clinician to be legally able to breach confientiality, you have to have demonstrable and immediate intent, not just ideation. That means you need to be committed to carrying out a suicide plan within a couple of days at most, the means need to be accessible to you, and the plan itself needs to have a high likelihood of lethality.  Besides that, you need to be either unable or unwilling to agree to a safety plan.

Also the doctrine of informed consent applies, so you're entitled to know exactly where any practitioner draws the line before you disclose anything, but the onus is usually on you to ask.

The internet is full of horror stories of dubious provenance, and actual fuck-ups do occur, I'd never deny it.  But almost all of us who actually work in suicide intervention know that involuntary interventions are horrible for the client and we do everything we can to help people feel better and be safe using less drastic measures."
"As of today, I'm no longer a depressed teenager!",Came here expecting a story where you are no longer depressed but instead I got a laugh
This is how I tried to explain to my (gamer) friend how depression feels like:,That was beautiful.
"I hate it when people say that people self harm or talk about killing themselves just to get attention. Of course they want attention, they need HELP.","->Psh, you're just doing it for the attention. Be quiet.

*1 month later*

->Why did they kill themselves? How selfish of them! They should have talked to someone."
Has your memory gotten worse with your depression?,It's gotten terrible. To the point I don't know if I did a thing a week ago or a year ago. I can barely remember how old I am. It's a symptom of this beast.
"I wish I could just press a button and never have existed. Everyone would forget me, and I'd just be gone.",I find myself thinking of this often as well. Life is cruel and unrelentless it doesn't care what your wishes are unfortunately.
I spoke to my UPS guy.,"Yay! I bet the UPS guy enjoys delivering packages to you then/ appreciate you as a customer. My boyfriend was a UPS work he would always go on UPS rants about how hard it is to work there and stuff like that. Apparently UPS people have on 30 seconds to 1 minute to get out of their truck, find the package, bring into the house, sign, and get back in the truck. UPS person must like you if they took the time out their very busy schedule to talk to you! I hope you the best! It's the small steps! "
"Every time I'm faced with some kind of challenge my first thought is ""I should just kill myself so I don't have to do this."" It's pathentic.","""I don't want to go to work. If I call in sick, it's pathetic and I'll get fired.  Can't be fired if I kill myself."""
"Does anyone else want to die without committing suicide""","I sometimes /do/ feel like that. For me, I think it's because… I don't really want to die. I don't want to die, ever. But I really think that not existing might be easier. If I didn't have this pain. So I can only say, I relate to you. The feeling of wanting to be gone. Wanting to be numb- Without knowing it's happening, you might say. Without controlling it. So I knew it wasn't my fault. That it was fate. It's… A difficult feeling, truly. I hope you forget that feeling, OP. Everyone deserves life."
"So I have this virus ""depression.exe"" on my computer...",I really like your metaphorical take on depression. I hope the computer somehow starts to override the virus.
Does anyone else feel like they’re falling behind everyone else their age?,[deleted]
"Some people think depression/anxiety is just a way to get attention, but attention is the last thing I want. Just leave me alone and let me die.","All i want is actual friends, but being depressed makes that impossible, and then im more depressed being alone. Its a circle thats impossible to escape"
"Every time I try to speak about my depression, it sounds like a cliche. So I keep it to myself.","I totally sympathise, man. Every time I try explain how I feel, the abscess of loneliness and self-hatred in me, the total lack of purpose and meaning, the maddening tedium of existence, I just think ""this sounds like a fucking teenager's diary"" and don't bother.

I guess it's better to talk than repress it all, but I totally get you. You don't want to come off like a stereotypical whiny child. I guess we just have to accept that this is how we feel and a good person will take us at face value and empathise."
Anyone else feel like when they ask people for help that you are being a burden?,I hate asking people for anything it just makes me feel stupid and childish. 
My friends remembered my birthday,It's genuinely nice to see someone post about progress or even a good day here to be honest.  It's a bit refreshing. Happy birthday.
"Do you ever just look at people and think, ""Wow, Im a giant loser""",[deleted]
What depression isn't.,"you put it into words so accurately.
I hate being asked 'whats wrong?' and just being unable to answer, I want to have an answer but I don't, I can only phrase is casually as 'feeling down'

"
"Has anyone ever had a period of being okay, only to crash back down into the blackness without any discernable reason why?","Indeed, I have cycles myself, I 100% believe for me it's a hormonal issue (as I have PCOS and PMDD, both different kinds of hormonal imbalances) but I was initially (wrongly) diagnosed with BPD...anyways, yeah, it's a terrible cycle, being 'happy' now comes with extreme anxiety because it's a constant 'when will I fall back into the pit?' thought on loop while I should be just enjoying the 'good' times. I'm sorry I have nothing to really offer except the bittersweet truth that you're not alone."
"I feel like i'm drifting through life, seeing how far I get before I kill myself.",Same. Suicide is always in the back of my mind.
"I’ve had to stop my own mom from killing herself. I’ve had to stop her from beating me or my siblings. I’ve pulled her off my dad. She’s crazy. And it’s been like this for 17 years. Thanks, mom (and dad). Happy holidays.","You are truly an amazing person. It's tough for any person, at any age, to have to go through this. So first, pat yourself on the back for being able to not only bear this burden, but for taking it a special step further by trying to heal the scars of others. You are genuinely a good person. It is these tough times that show the true spirit of someone, and you've definitely shown your resilience here."
does the idea of living the rest of your life just sound exhausting,"the worst part seems to be that there is no end in sight.
i go to sleep and next morning its the same shit all over again"
Anyone else feel so nostalgic for the past when things were okay that it actually physically hurts?,"i am severely depressed, but ironically the length of my depression is somewhat helping me in my darkest moments.

&#x200B;

i know that eventually, in a few days, weeks, or a month i'll do something and be happy for a short period of time and that it's maybe not forever.

&#x200B;

i don't know. i'd kill to go back in time, my emotions are like a fucking roller coaster and i'm in a very, very deep spot rn. 

&#x200B;

i just hope i hit another good spot soon."
My girlfriend died and I don't know how to go on...,"I am so sorry to hear about this. 
I can't imagine the pain, anger, confusion you must feel right now. 
Please take all the time you need to grieve. You don't have to rush anything, you need to focus on yourself always."
I can’t stand it anymore. I’m committing suicide. This is my story. Being good and positive won’t help u stop suffering.,"I’m saving this post so that I can remember you and you’re story. I won’t let you be forgotten.

Please, respond to me if you are still alive."
Does anyone make drafts and ends up not posting?,"I’ve done a lot of this. Made my first post this morning. Even if no one responds, it felt good to say it “out loud”"
"Depression: The disease that makes you isolate yourself from your friends, and then helps you be extra miserable later when your friends do things without you.","I relate to this pretty hard. I wish I could be social when I want to be, instead of backing out of shit all the time because I'm not feeling it. "
"""You're a goner"" - my therapist lol","Geez that's kinda harsh . I've had my fair share of therapists as well , and I know for a fact that they tend to not pay attention to what comes out of their mouth sometimes. They tend to forget that they are talking to someone who's dealing with serious issues and jokes like that are too much some times. Take stuff like that with a grain of salt , that's what I do:)"
Have you ever felt so sad that you actually feel a sharp sore pain in your heart?,"Hey man, just wanted to say that yeah, I've gotten that sharp sore pain. Kinda feels like your heart's being suffocated, or wrung and swallowing sometimes makes it go away or get worse. I hope you're doing better, but I understand those feelings. I have a hard time finding value in anything in the mirror, so, I'm with you. And I know you'll get through it. You can do it."
anyone else here have no real hobbies/goals/interests and justs waste time on reddit/youtube/etc ?,"Yep, that's how my whole day is spent these days. I used to play video games but I just can't anymore."
"I don’t know if i’m still depressed. I don’t feel numb or sad, but i feel unmotivated, unfulfilled, blank and flat. I don’t want to end it all, but i don’t care if i live or die.",I know how you feel. It seems as if we’ve undergone so much pain that we’re just numb to it now. It’s...confusing.
Yesterday I finally went to the doctors to speak about my mental health!!!!,I’m so glad to hear that you’re on the road to recovery. You can totally overcome your depression and lead an enjoyable life once again.
Am I becoming less intelligent?,i certainly feel that way too! it's almost as if my thoughts are permanently running at a 600ms ping compared to the rest of me
I drew out what my depression feels like.,"Thank you for sharing this. I know it's difficult to share this kind of thing, even if it is just anonymous internet people. I can really feel your frustration and despair in this."
You don't get it,"Fuck those cunts

For me emptiness and nothingness it does is the worst part, when I feel as if I don't mean anything to the world and all self worth is gone and I wish day to day it could just be over"
I feel like I'm feeling less and less excited about stuff.,"I feel you. It’s really hard to get excited about things when you’re feeling low, even things that you’d normally be stoked to do. If it helps, you’re definitely not alone. I am currently sitting on my bed contemplating crawling back under the covers when I’m actually running late to meet someone."
Does anyone else feel that people only “tolerate” you?,"I feel like this a lot. I’ve had many different friends over the years but never felt like I mean as much to them as they do to me. I’ve always ended up being the one who ends up out of touch with the group while the rest of them remain friends. 

Over time i’ve learnt that it’s a cycle, the more I feel like that the more I unconsciously tend to remove myself from the group or distance myself. But if you push through that feeling and talk to them about it and be honest you’ll find the ones that really care and will put the effort in to try and stop you feeling like that. It may take a little while and sometimes people won’t react how you hoped. 

I don’t have a big group of friends now but I have a couple that make the effort and will message me when we haven’t spoken for a while, they make sure I don’t feel like that anymore.

I have found it’s just best to talk and be honest but if you find that too hard I understand. Just keep trying with friends and maybe try and make friends with people who may feel similar or understand. 

I hope you start to feel appreciated and cared for soon. "
Does anyone else feel like depression has lowered their intelligence over the years?,Same here. But it is mostly that I don't care about studying anymore. I want to learn but I just can't. I am dumb.
I feel like I’m not as important in other people’s lives as they are in mine,My only friends are my best friends from 10 years ago because I'm terrified of making new friends. Theyre still my best friend but they have other people in their life they see more often.  Comparing myself to their other friends just causes me pain so i just try and appreciate them for what they are. I'm lucky to have them in my life at all.  I'm such a fuck up. 
Why do I feel like everyone secretly strongly dislikes me?,"Same. I just hung out with a group of friends and it went well but as soon as I get home I started analyzing every word I said. I kept thinking I shouldn’t have said this or that, they probably think this about me. I don’t know how to make it stop."
Hospital bills after suicide attempt,[removed]
"Anyone else basically waste all their time on reddit, youtube video games, discord, youtube etc etc all day ?","Yes, I don't even enjoy it anymore. I used to play video games a lot, but it's just too much effort now. I regulary watched Youtube, but not anymore. Mostly Reddit and discord and lying in bed doing nothing."
I took a shower for the 2nd day a row :),"i know the feeling, proud of you."
"I created my first reddit because my boyfriend was drowning in his depression, and I wanted desperately to help him. Since then, I've gained more insight and listened to all you beautiful people and because of you, I've learned how to better help him.","The world needs more SOs like you, hope your boyfriend is doing well. "
Has anybody else been mentally ill for so long now that sometimes you don't even realize how bad it is anymore?,"Been chronically depressed for.... let's see... almost 13 years now? I'm 26, so that's half of my life. I honestly only remember bits and pieces from how happy I was before depression set in, but nothing has ever gotten better. Only worse.

At least 6 different therapists, a week-long mental hospital stay, extreme lifestyle changes, lots of retail therapy, and too many drug combinations to count... still nothing.

I'm now in a phase of trying to convince myself that my depression serves a purpose in the bigger picture. If there weren't super sad people in the world, there probably wouldn't be super happy people in the world to balance them out. It's a thankless job, but I'll take it."
"This is horrible, but... Does anyone fantasize about ending up in the hospital, being bedridden for a while?",[deleted]
Unemployed Therapist,"I know the feeling of falling into the abyss as the world continues around oneself at a feverish pace.

Your family might not be emotionally supportive but unless they've gone through it themselves it's not surprising. My own family asked me ""what I was doing to them"" as I was descending into despair. Sometimes the best one can hope for is logistical support.

You deserve better care. Your therapist and PCP have failed you. Keep looking for someone that works.

It may feel like the clock is ticking to get back to ""normal"", specifically to go back to work. But as they say on airplanes, ""put on your own oxygen mask before helping others."" Take the time to get better and when you're ready it won't feel like you're hiding behind a fake smile."
Anyone else take days to recover from a insult?,What do you mean recover? I remember almost every shitty thing someone has said to me whether I knew them or not
Attempted suicide last night. Now I'm being guarded 24/7 by police officers.,"Being guarded like that will happen when you're a danger to yourself. It's profoundly unpleasant and scary and humiliating, but it keeps you alive until you can get a little more perspective and keep yourself alive.

People react irrationally when someone's in danger. Sometimes they get mad at you for being sick. Nobody's going to react the same way, but they're scared and upset - maybe not as scared and upset as you are, but still - and it's hard for them to have perspective just like it's hard for you.

A friend of mine died from suicide a few years ago. I couldn't believe it at first. Then I was furious with him. Then I found myself imagining that if he were still around I wouldn't ask him to pay me back the eighty bucks he owed me. Then I said holy shit, this whole denial-anger-bargaining-etc stages of grief thing really happens.

Give it time. I'm sorry you're hurting.

People wonder why depressed or suicidal people don’t get help,"but by telling them, you wouldn't be saying that at all. In my opinion, by seeking help you are trying to \*keep\* the life they sacrificed everything for. by not seeking help, suicide is a real risk,in fact its probably the natural conclusion if you keep your silence about this.

Depression is the worst pain I've ever felt.,I wholeheartedly agree- or what’s left of my heart anyway. I’ve literally lost any sense of identity I used to have at this point. I’m just a black hole of pain.
Do you ever cope by imagining a person/world that makes you feel safe?,"I do it all the time, in fact, I like to stay in bed for hours just imagining another world."
I’m only 19 but I can’t shake this feeling that my life is over.,"I'm 42 now.  You never stop thinking about the good old days.  By the way, I have underwear older than you.  

As you get older you laugh more about how you acted at 13,14,15 and so on.  

I had a rough time growing up being a disabled child in public school. Picked on bullied, you name it.  Some kid even shit in my lunch bag.

I can laugh about it all now.  At 42 I'm the happiest I have ever been.  I have my moments for sure, and I will always have some depression.  I fill my life with positive people only.  I smile and say hello to strangers.  Sometimes I buy the person behind me their coffee."

Anyone depressed in spite of good life circumstances?,Depression is an illness. An illness doesn't come with a background check to your life. Nobody asks to be ill and you don't have to have a reason to be ill.

There's the feeling of the overwhelming onslaught of time, the inevitability of falling further and further behind..."
Depression is addicting,"I feel the same, if I had to guess it's that depression has become the norm, it's ""comforting"" in a way, that it's become all I know really, so anything else seems too much of a change, especially when it takes so much effort to even move, its seems impossible to make enough of a change."

Definitely creates a weird duality and being intorverted is just icing on the cake."

I often think depression is just realizing how the world really works.,"Andrew Solomon did a TED Talk about this exact feeling. He said something along the lines of ""Depression isn't looking through a veil that makes everything sad, it's feeling like the veil has been lifted and you're seeing the world for what it really is.""

Below is his TED Talk. You should absolutely watch it. Honestly, it helped me understand my depression in a way that I had never felt before. It changed my life.

Does anyone else welcome the idea of an accidental death?,"Yeah, I do this pretty often as well. Mostly I just go to sleep hoping I don't wake up but when I find myself behind a semi carrying something big I hope that it falls off and kills me.

Do you ever feel like you're just not cut out for this world?,"This may be a niche opinion, but honestly, I feel that there is something wrong with modern life.

In a competitive, fast-paced, corrupt and consumerist world, there's no compassion, and there's no fulfillment.

And the school system is part of it-- fucking up kids from the very beginning.

Either you fool yourself into believing that everything is fine in society, or else in the back of your mind it will drive you insane. That plus the unpleasant and unhealthy environments we build for ourselves-- concrete, traffic noise, pollution-- sitting in chairs for 8+ hours a day-- I think that is why depression is affecting so many people.

I don't know how to escape the rat race but I think that is what I need. Personally I hate consumerism.

For you, maybe you need a more cooperative and nurturing environment. Because school is not that.

I hope you can find more peace and acceptance in your life soon."

Ever get so depressed that you stop wanting to get better?,"You’re not alone here. I am currently in the process of finally making steps to pulling myself out of the lowest low period that I have experienced so far and I found myself not wanting to “get better” for about 5 months. I had  accepted that I was alive but was not living and had no will to live but no courage to end it. I even quit my job thinking that would give me some relief and take some pain away it didn’t do anything but make me useless and drain my savings (bringing me even more down) for those months.

I think one of my main fears is that I'm not depressed...just lazy,"My mother likes to say this a lot; that I'm not depressed, just lazy. I have to explain to her over and over that lazy is not wanting to get up and do the fishes because the couch is comfy.  Depression is being practically catatonic. (Then I had to define catatonic.) Also, people don't fantasize about committing suicide because they're lazy. People don't hate themselves because they're lazy.

"I was depressed as a teenager, worked hard and got my own place and all the things I thought would make me feel better, and now I'm more depressed than ever in my mid 20s.","That's the point people don't seem to get.

Summer before my second year in university, I decided to snap out of it and gather all my strength to accomplish everything I set my mind to. I thought not being succesful was the source of my misery. I started eating healthy, lost 36&#37; of my body weight, forced myself to get out every weekend and socialize as much as possible, studied hard and aced almost every single subject that year. I'm majoring in physics so that was hard as hell. Everyone around me was so proud. But a year after I realized I felt nothing. No satisfaction, pride, happiness... Nothing. I wasn't sure why I was doing anything anymore. I just felt empty. 

Why bother? Why suffer through everything life throws at you when no outcome makes you happy?"
One of the cruelest things about depression: when even your friends' accomplishments and happiness start bringing your mood down.,"You want to hear something depressing? I introduced my best friend to the only girl I've ever loved. Told him to ask her to a banquet we had. I would have but was too afraid, and I didn't want her to go alone.

They're getting married in a few months. I still love her.

Edit: I'm humbled by the support here. Thanks so much everyone, it really means a lot to me."
Do you ever feel that trying to talk about your feelings is totally pointless?,Exactly why I don't bother anymore talking about my feelings. It never made me feel better and there's always a possibility that someone will be turned off by my feelings. I almost lost friends discussing my feelings which is why I just internalize my issues.

Anybody else stays up late on Sunday because they're afraid of the week?,"I stay up late pretty much every night.

Does anybody feel like they were born too weak and sensitive for this world?,"I’m extremely sensitive. I take everything as a personal insult, if someone dislikes me then I take it very seriously!

Just saying “I have depression” feels like I’m minimizing what I’m actually experiencing,"Confession time:

&#x200B;

For this exact reason, I don't always tell people that I have depression. Sometimes people need to know we have this thing we're dealing with (employers, SOs, roommates, family members, etc). Depending on the context, I will sometimes straight up lie to people if I have to, and say that I have one (or more) of a number of problems. For example, if I can't get out of bed all day, but I know my boss will make a value judgment if I say ""depression"", I call in with a ""migraine"". I sometimes say I have ""chronic pain"", ""chronic illness"", or a ""neurological problem"".

The deal is, you have needs because of Depression, which is an illness. Virtually everyone is prepared to be understanding to someone who is ill. You need to do whatever you have to do to be granted the same understanding and compassion you would be granted if the person you were talking to legitimately believed you were ill, because you are. 

And because you are ill, your job is to make sure you get what you need to stay sane and functional. Your job is NOT:

* Educating people about depression
* Convincing them that mental illnesses are real, actual, physical problems
* Convincing them that mental illness =/= moral failing
* Defending how you cope with your depression to someone who thinks you just need to lighten up

In my experience, saying the word ""depression"" absolutely invites one of the above debates, when my main goal is not to debate, but rather to explain myself or solve problems. So I usually figure out what my end goal is (I need to protect my friends' feelings because I cancel a lot), and then figure out how I can get there. If I'm close to the person in question and feel they're not judgy about the ""Depression"" label, I can be 100% honest. If I'm unsure, or if they're known to be hostile about mental illness, I pick the best ""cover story"" illness that will suit my needs and get me to the end goal (like not getting fired). In time, if the person seems amenable, I might open up to them more."

Running away didn't solve the problem. The newness fades. You'll fall back into the same old habits. I might as well still be home.

Girlfriend attempted suicide. I'm a wreck.,"It's a very complicated situation because you both have depression. Just to give an example, I'm bipolar and my daughter is borderline and I've had to help her a few times. In time I learned to save myself from this situations, to preserve myself in order to be able to stand and to help her. I do not think about unnecessary things for at this moments (for example, blaming myself for being in that situation, or that I'm not doing enough). Clean and silence the mind. Only allow thoughts to lighten your load. Instead of thinking that she tried to kill herself, think of her being alive, being medicated and cared  and that you arrived on time.

Cut to 2 months later and they all either ignored me when I reached out for help or just slowly started avoiding me. Made me feel really guilty.
Does anyone else feel shame in their depression because having it seems cliché and overused these days?,"I never hear people say that they're depressed, but then I don't have much of a social life. In any case, I'm willing to bet that most of these people are just dealing with run-of-the-mill, everyday type of sadness, and confuse that with depression. They're not the same thing. Depression is like sadness on steroids, times 1,000. It can last for your entire life without ever improving or going away. I've had problems with that and anxiety for roughly 20 years. It sucks. But I don't even talk about myself to anyone anymore, because I'm sick of the stereotypical responses - ""other people have it worse"", ""Why are you so negative all the time?"", ""everyone has bad days"", etc. It's just tiresome when, in addition to battling your demons, you feel like you have to validate your personal struggles to people who, rather than simply try to be supportive or helpful feel the need to challenge you on whether or not you actually have problems at all.

TIRED of hearing it'll get BETTER when it clealy ISN'T,"People don't understand something like this until they've gone through it, people just tell you to ""be happy"" and ""stop being sad and cheer up"" but it doesn't work like that, they just don't understand.. they don't understand.. just people with such grand lives living in a good world, good lives, with such uniqueness, just an overall good life.. then they tell people to cheer up, yeah, so easy to say when their life is so good"
Does anyone else's mind like to randomly tell you that you should die?,Me too. It's frightening. It feels like my mind isn't mine anymore. 
Why do parents care more about school work than your mental state?,Same except they dont know about my depression and never will
Do you ever wish with all your heart that you never existed?,"If I could choose to have anything, I would create a dream to form my own reality (why I love sleeping so much) but since that’s not completely possible I’ll take nothingness over this world "
Do you guys feel like every little task is exhausting?,"Yes! I didn’t think anyone else thought about each little aspect of life like I do. I don’t understand how people who don’t suffer from this have the energy to do everyday tasks. I woke up today, thought about all the things I should do, and immediately had to go back to sleep for a few hours because I couldn’t find the strength to get up and actually do anything, minuscule tasks seem so daunting when we feel this way"
anyone else miss being a kid?,The more I think about the more I realize I never really was happy
"I'm off my medication, haven't cut myself in 70 days and I've been going to school.","This is great. The only thing I want to caution you about is... it takes about one or two months for the medication's effects to be completely out of your system.

So pay attention to how you feel a month from now, two months from now, three months from now. If you feel bad again, talk to your doctor.

I was off my antidepressants for a while but then got back on again. I wish someone had warned me how bad I would feel after a while of being off the meds."
has anyone else been depressed since they were children?,"I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. As a little kid I was utterly terrified of everything and constantly miserable and lonely. As much as I have troubles now, I'd never want to go back to being a kid and dealing with that horror all over again. Of course objectively my life was fine as a kid. A few friends, decent grades, all that jazz, but I was miserable. You aren't alone."
Do you ever feel like nothing matters because you'll probably end up killing yourself anyway?,"Problem is if you're like 99% of people who do that and never follow through with suicide, then you're left with a mess of a life that you still can't escape from. I did that over the past 5 years, one of the few sources of enjoyment I had left was that I like eating unhealthy food, so I did it without restriction feeling like I had nothing else to live for and I would kill myself after a while. Gained a ton of weight, didn't make any effort in any other areas of my life, of course never killed myself, so now added to my list of depression is that I could probably afford to lose 70lbs. 

It's understandable why people find it soothing to set a deadline and believe that your escape is within your control, but you have to be really honest with yourself if you think you've got the nerve to do it. I've talked to other people sporadically over the years and every time I hear from them they just have a fresh new deadline and a new plan for how they're gonna kill themselves. A few months or a year go by and the next time I hear from them in an email it's the same thing. Meanwhile they didn't do anything to make life better because they keep planning to leave. 

Get busy living or get busy dying. You'd probably do it right this moment if you were so certain that's the path you want to take. It's plenty easy to believe you have the courage to commit suicide when it's some far-off theoretical thing. 

It's a good thing that most people don't follow through with their plans when they expect to, except for the consequence that then your life is a bigger mess because you weren't making any effort that whole time. "

"Dear mods: Can you please do something about the influx of tough love zealots on this subreddit? It's a clear violation of the rules on the sidebar for anyone to advocate tough love bullshit. We need you to crack down on this. People are getting insulted, emotionally abused and put down daily.","When it comes to enforcing rules like this, we really have to rely on the community to report violations and bring problems to our attention. Reporting these people you see using tough love is the best way to help us make sure that the community stays the safe space that we all want it to be. 

There is not a *single* mod that supports the use of tough love, as it can push people further into depression and can even trigger suicidal thoughts. Even if it gives a short term boost, there's almost always a really nasty crash afterwards. It simply is not an effective way to talk to people, and generally makes people feel bad. 

In regards to the sidebar - I would recommend you message the mod team as a whole with the suggestion about changing the placement. That said, our experience has been that the people who tend to utilize tough love usually believe that they are right, and that the rules don't apply to them, or don't read the sidebar at all. 

TL;DR - Report tough love comments! We'll remove them!"
"im so lonely, but i no longer have any energy to maintain a relationship.","I understand this. I feel exactly the same way.

When I see people post something that sounds like depression I always make an effort to reach out. I actually posted a ""help me"" post but no one bothered to ask me how I felt.

I know it can be a pretty dark place. I'm glad I've found someone like you who knows how I feel. We are not alone.

As far as getting through it, take it 1 day at a time. There will always be bad days but I just pray at night that I hope to wake up the next day feeling better."
"The shittiest feeling is looking back on your day, and knowing full well you could've done a lot, but you didn't.","I understand more than you know. Sometimes the night prior I think about all the great things I’m going to do the next day; I get pumped thinking tomorrow is THE DAY when I’m finally going to get my shit together. Then the sun rises and I wake up and I’m paralyzed, all of the motivation I had the night before is gone, like a dream, like it never existed. Then I drag my feet through the day, accomplishing a few minor things here and there; doing the dishes; making the bed. I convince myself throughout the day that I’ve done something I’ve completed something. Then the day is over and I look back and realize I accomplished NOTHING. 

It’s a tough feeling and I’m working through it in therapy but know that you’re not alone and the key is to take it day by day. Give yourself small achievable goals, no matter how small getting them done will hopefully make you feel a little better.  And if you need to talk, this community will listen."
*Check this box if you have been feeling hopeless everyday for 2 week.*," Went to my therapist and had a similar form to fill out. I filled it out honestly, and she goes, ""According to this, you should be hospitalized. Go ahead and pick a different answer.""

The Robin Williams Posts Are Triggering,"All I can think of is the pain, torment, despair he felt to get to the point that he felt he needed to take his own life. It is ripping me apart. 
Unless you live it and have been in that pit of hell, it is hard for others to understand the depth and intensity of the despair and how others and their ""help"" can just piss you off.

It is not cowardly to die by your own hand, it is a sign of such profound despair and lack of hope, exhaustion with life and no capacity to live another day....and that is not cowardly, that is just plain tragic.

And sadly, depression will haunt us forever, even with the drugs and treatment. It really gets to me since I am an old redditor. Mr. Williams and I are separated in age by less than a decade. After years and decades of pain, and just getting so sick of this illness, and the relapses, and the battle to maintain some semblance of mental health I can see so clearly why he felt he needed to do it....and that makes me very sad for all of us."

"I don’t want to kill myself but if I died right now, I wouldn’t mind.","I understand family naturally comes first, but I've grown to realize that my parents arent some perfect omnipotent figure in my life. They're just normal people, like you or me. And everyone is fucked up in some way or another. Ultimately its your life. If you're sad because of how they're affecting you, just know that in time you won't be a sad person when you're older and moved out (genetics is a bitch though). Just go out but let them know where you are, who you're with, and when you'll be home. Bring them something back like food, or just talk to them about your night when you get the chance to. It makes it so they won't worry and they know you're still thinking about them

"For me, Depression isn’t overwhelming sadness; it painfully boring",I understand this. I used to feel a lot of the overwhelming sadness but lately it's kind of just an dissatisfaction with everything. I seem better to everyone else because I'm still going through the motions of every day but I don't feel any better.
If depression were a smashed hand.,"I work in mental health, and when people have trouble with understanding depression, I like to compare it to diabetes.

"Anyone else here feel dazed, zombie-fied and emotionless?",[deleted]
I'm lonely but I hate when people talk to me.,"When I fall into the rabbit hole, the worst part are all the contradictions that come with it. I wish someone would find me and help me, but I know I won't be found because I hide. I wish someone would talk to me and tell me they understand, but I don't want people to speak to me or to know I am this way. I wish that I could be happy and experience life in a way I only dream about, but I want to hide under hundreds of layers of blankets and go to sleep and stay asleep as long as I can. I want to love the world, but I want to see it burn. These completely contradicting and ambivalent feelings not only make things worse, but make me exhausted. They keep me in a perpetual state of mental and physical exhaustion, its a sort of tired you don't find anywhere else; I always wonder if others have felt this sort of lethargy, this sort of fatigue. This fatigue in tandem with this ambivalent and contradictory state of mind make me feel insane, to the point where I'm both laughing and crying simultaneously. I never know how long its going to last, but I know everytime I think to myself, ""How did you get out of this last time? When was last time? I know I felt better at some point, but I can't remember what it felt like."" Its like a lead ball stuck inside my head, behind my eyes, smack-dab in the middle."

Do you ever feel like your depression is becoming your whole personality?,"Absolutely. People are always so adamant that “my mental illness doesn’t define me.” But after being depressed for years, I’d be lying if I said depression doesn’t define me. It informs my every thought, action, and interest. The best and worst experiences of my life are qualified as such by my depressed brain. I’ve lived in this state 24/7 for the last six years and I honestly think it’d be naive for me (or anyone else) to think that’s not going to affect my personality. 

It sucks because most people don’t want to hear suicide jokes or talk about the morbid things my depressed brain latches onto. It’s very isolating and confusing when your depression becomes inseparable from your personality and day to day thoughts."
"""Suicide is selfish""","So the idea that ""suicide is selfish"" is either a true or useful way to prevent suicide is a serious misconception that all of us on the mod team are concerned about and wish would stop also. Current scientific models of suicidality suggest that suicidality is a (usually inappropriate) activation of the mechanism whereby an individual removes itself for the benefit of the herd. 

While the feelings that the Universe would be better off without us are usually tragically wrong - even among people who feel very much as if that would be true and no one would miss them - evolutionarily the feelings of suicidality come from a source that's the exact opposite of selfishness. 

As a note, this is a support community, not a space for general philosophical discussion (/r/philosophy and /r/suicidology exist for that) - it's fine to share personal experiences and perspective in supporting others but general debate goes elsewhere.

We also encourage people seeking support specifically for suicidal thoughts to post in /r/SuicideWatch - suicidality and depression are now known to be separate phenomena without a causal relationship (though they often happen together, it's very possible to experience one without the other) so that's the most frequently helpful space on reddit to find support for that, as the space is intended specifically for that and we do all we can to make people aware of the guidelines there. 

(And as the sidebar there notes, guilt-tripping such as ""suicide is selfish"" specifically breaks them (and falls under the ""tough love"" rule in this sub), because this kind of guilt-tripping can actually put people at higher risk - the only ethical way to help someone at risk of suicide is to give them empathetic and non-judgemental support that helps living become more bearable. ""Suicide is selfish"" does nothing to decrease anyone's pain - only add to it because it's judging us for having the thoughts we're having in addition to suffering about as badly as it's possible for us to be to begin with!)"
"Does anyone feel like depression stops them from being the person they were born to be, but then feels guilt and anxiety about trying to become that person.","I wish I could find the comment I saw a few weeks ago on a sub I don't remember. It really hit home for me. It was a lot more specific than I am about to be but are you familiar with Rick and Morty? If not, it's hilarious and I highly recommend you watch it. 
The basic message of that comment was that no life is meant to exist. We are all an accident with no path or predetermined fate. We're not letting anyone down when we deal with our brains and emotions because we A) don't owe anything to anyone in the first place, and B) how do we have a measurement of who you're 'supposed' to be if you're not supposed to be anything. 

Healing has to start from the inside. Remember that you're doing a great job by getting up everyday. Take it easy on yourself. The only person that thinks you have something to prove is you. Success is what you make it.

"Does anyone else feel like they can no longer feel their own emotions, but instead have just learned to mimic those of the people around them in order to seem ""normal?""",I don't feel anything.

"Does anyone else want to just sleep for a long, long time?",Sometimes I just sleep because my dreams are more tolerable than reality. 
Does anyone else feel like they constantly need fresh starts?,I ran out of fresh restart opportunities years ago.
Where does my mental illness stop and my personality begin?,"I know how you feel, I've had depression for just under 20 years and I thought it was my personality but it isn't. Once medicated I realised that depression was like ear protection and the noise is your personality. It muffled it and makes it hard to hear.

In other words, your depression is suppressing your personality. There's a wonderful, bright person in there and receiving help is the first step in bringing that person out. You won't regret it!"
"That's not how it works, asshole",It's just another example of how people treat things if they don't know how it feels. I'm depressed and have anxiety. Where the fuck am I living then?

"No social skills, no romance, no love. No hope for the future.","Ironically for not being able to hold a conversation you have written quite a compelling account of your problem. Joking aside I know how you feel because I've been there. You never feel more alone than when you hate yourself. And that's where the true issue lies. You feeling bad about your social anxiety and depression doesn't do anyone and especially yourself any good. Take pride in the fact that you are trying despite the odds, despite the depression, despite what others think. Not many people could bear your burden. It is up to you how to deal with it, it can crush you or it can make you stronger if you let it."

I don't know if it was the right or wrong decision, but all I know is that I was able to have experiences I never would have had if I took my life."

*argues it's validity* 

I'm with you, OP. "
Do you ever feel that when you're in your depression you see the world more clearly than other people?,"It's more of a mixed bag if you ask me. On the one hand, depression does allow you to view certain aspects of the world more accurately than people who tend to be positive and optimisic. On the other hand, however, depression can also cause people to view the world from a distorted perspective in which the negatives are highly exaggerated and the positives are very much downplayed. It's more of a trade-off in the end of the day."
Does anyone else feel like they're a burden on their parents?,"Mhm. I feel the exact same as you do.

That feeling where...you wonder what happened in life that made you so flawed and fucked up beyond redemption. Even to the point where you know your parents kind of gave up on you. And while you know they still love you, they kind of know you're a failure.

Does anyone else spend most of their time laying in bed?,"Guilty as charged. I find myself laying in bed on my phone all the time. My family hates it and accuses me of not wanting to spend time with them. It’s nothing against them, it’s just I wanna be left alone. So much for depression."

I’m lonely but I hate being around people.,"Yeah, that's what ive experienced for a while.  Think it's a symptom of dissociation (feeling separate from yourself, feelings, your body, other people, in your head all the time).

Its so frustrating cause just when I think i actually want to spend time with people, i realize its a terrible mistake 5 minutes into the conversation and then im trapped for another 20 minutes, minimum."
Why can’t i fucking DO anything?,"Just spitballing, maybe the best way to have an interest is to build it? Maybe try doing something (I know, hard for depressiez) that would eventually get your dopamine flowing. For instance, when I play Skyrim, I'm pretty fucking bored for the first two minutes, regardless of whether or not I have to sit through that fucking intro over again. Eventually, though, I want to progress through the quests more, wanting to get the sense of achievement (reward: dopamine) and new shit that I feel from my effort. In other words, I want something, so I wanted to do something else to get it.

In order to want to *do* something, maybe you have to *want* something else.

Don't chase the chemicals that make up happiness, but chase the things that will give you them. (Or release them in your brain, whatever.)"

I think I'm destined to be disliked.,"You may be overestimating the amount of responsibility you can take for the fact that it is incredibly difficult to meet interesting and kind people and befriend them, then maintain a sustainable and meaningful relationship.

If you check off the following items then you are doing fine and should not worry about being a waste of space.

1. Are you mostly hygienic so that you look and smell clean and people don't have to be afraid of touching or being near you?
2. Are you polite for the most part and don't upset people unnecessarily and intentionally?
3. Are you mostly independent and responsible so you don't constantly have to ask for favors, cause problems, borrow things, or be overly dependent on the people around you resulting in them resenting you?

If you said yes to all three then you are fine. You are as good of an adult as anyone can expect you to be and should not feel bad about yourself. That doesn't guarantee you a romantic relationship, a successful career, or happiness. Most if not all of us don't live fulfilling lives. That's just the way things are it's not necessarily your fault.

I sleep with a stuffed animal to feel less lonely,"Bruh I’m 22 and I still sleep with or hold a stuffed animal when I’m having an especially rough time or can’t fall asleep... I have a big, worn out pikachu from when I was a kid and a bulbasaur from build-a-bear. Won’t even try to hide the fact that I bought the bulbasaur specifically so I wouldn’t be lonely when I went to work in Germany for a few months last year.

Idk man, I used to be kinda embarrassed but it’s something that helps me feel better, and that’s what counts. Plus girls love getting teddy bears and all that, probably cuddle them sometimes too. Shouldn’t be any different just because you’re a guy. In my mind, it would be more pathetic if I *knew* that a stuffed animal would make me feel better, but I didn’t buy one just because I was afraid of what someone else might think. You do you, dude.

"People say you can't kill yourself, but then they disappear when you need help. Fuck everyone.","I don't reach out to people because I feel like I'm most likely an annoyance. People who aren't depressed or don't know what it's like are unlikely to really sympathize or understand. I realize it's also really emotionally draining to other people to want them to be there and listen to all of your depressing problems. Essentially, people don't want to do things that aren't fun or uplifting. People have their own lives and problems to worry about. You have to realize most people aren't truly all about others, but mostly themselves. It's just human. 

Sometimes accepting this is key and learning to deal with it through other ways through self-help, self-reflection, or a therapist can be helpful instead of expecting everyone to be there because 9/10 times, they won't be. Nobody is going to want you to kill yourself. if you say you want to, nobody is going to be like ""yeah, you should go for it!"" 

I've gone through this long enough. It's more exhausting blaming everyone else for your depression and not being there for you than to just accept that this is a battle that you'll have to fight on your own.

EDIT: grammar asshole caught my accidental misuse of ""there"" and ""their"""
"today I woke up without hitting the snooze button, actually made myself coffee, did homework I could have put off, and showered standing up!","Sitting in the shower, hmm... thank you for giving me an alternative to skipping a shower!

"Many people I know wear ""I spend tons of hours at my job and I'm constantly exhausted"" like a badge of honor.

"""Sorry I didn't reply, I was taking a nap""",I do the same.
Anybody else just used to being depressed and accept that's how it is?,To be honest I'm not really sure if I ever get out of depression. For me it's always been the same and other things just get in the way and distract me. Being happy just appears to be preoccupied by the rest of life. 
The Internet has turned depression into a meme and I hate it.,"I love it. I can constantly say ""I wanna die"" or ""I await the sweet release of death"" and everybody will be like ""haha what a funny guy"""
“The best way to describe depression is the inability to construct a future.,"You're right, I have an idea of where I want to go but the thought of all the things that could possibly go wrong keep me frozen in fear and  unsure if I should even try

Sometimes I think it would just be easier to kill myself, then I wouldnt have to be in constant fear of life all the time"
Fuck Christmas,"I used to love christmas, now it just hurts"
Being African-American and having a mental illness is literally the worst combo there is,"I'm black and agnostic and I absolutely feel the same way. Any time I try to reach out to other black people, they pull the religion card or dismiss all my pain because I'm ""too young"" and ""disrespectful to god"" and - worst of all, to me - ""don't have anything to be sad about"". It's awful and exhausting."
Sleep isn't just sleep anymore. It's an escape.,Same for me. I only look forward to sleep at this point. Anything to escape reality.

Do you ever start thinking about someone and then realise they aren't thinking about you?,"Similar to this, I really enjoy this person's company. He drags me out of my comfort zone to experience new things. His personality just lifts my mood every time I see or talk to him. He's always on my mind and I kinda like him, but he probably doesn't think of me that way(or even at all)"
Idk,I wish there was a button that stops time so you can just relax

Repeat.","Every day I wake up, turn on the computer, screw around until it's time to do something like make food, feel agitated and restless, then hate that it's night and I have to sleep and do it again and also be one day closer until having to do or experience life things like school or another year.

I definitely feel like I'm just killing time, pissing life away without having the ability to do anything more."
"I've always had trouble articulating the severity of my depression, so I made some photographs that describe it instead. Thought you might enjoy.","Stunning. Absolutely fascinating and quite different, yet I understand each one. It's amazing to think that someone else knows those feelings. Very powerful.

Glad to hear that you've discovered this outlet and gotten some medical help as well. I do hope that your photographs have helped you in expressing what you're going through to others as well."
Does anyone else feel like that they've become a shell of their former self?,"I feel you. Whenever I’m in a group with people it feels like I’m not even there. If I say anything no one answers, it’s like I don’t exist. I feel like a ghost of my past self."
"My interpretation of depression. (Watercolor 9x11"")","Wow! Thank you all so much for the positive feedback. I'm happy to hear that my illustration resonated with others. I've never made prints of my art before, but it's something I will look into. PM me if you are interested.  "
"The only upside to having both anxiety and depression is that depression keeps me from doing things that will trigger the anxiety, and the anxiety keeps me from actively trying to kill myself.",Anxiety is what gets me out of bed and into work on the morning. 
Anyone else been depressed since childhood?,I have been for a very long time. I was teased and bullied throughout most of my school years. I remember always feeling like I wasn't good enough and like I would be better off dead. I never tried to get an official diagnoses until I was in my 20s
"I'm desperate, please don't ignore","This reminds me of depersonalization. It’s usually a symptom another of disease. It’s a type of dissociative disorder caused by another mental illness. 

It’s your brain trying to cope with bad feelings. 

First of all, know that you are fine. You are not in danger. You are real. The chemicals in your mind have shifted to create a state of detachment. This is an illness that can be treated. 

If there is someone with you, ask them to take you to the hospital. They will be able to help bring stability back to your mind. If no one is able to take you, call your emergency services and let them know you are having some mental issues and need to be safely brought to the hospital. 

These people will help you and make sure you get safely to someone who will get you what you need. 

Explain to them what you explained here. 


You’re going to be okay. This is not fatal, it’s just a state of mind that can be fixed. "
Are weekends really hard for anyone else?,"I feel the same way. I go to classes during the week, but on the weekends, I basically lay in bed and try to fall asleep to make the time go by faster. I have friends I could be with, but I think I am just a drag to be around, so I don’t want to burden them. Hopefully we will both get better someday. "
"7 years ago, I never thought that I would have considered suicide to get out of homework.","Same. Many years ago it seemed unthinkable to see suicide as an option for this. But like you, I have also had the same thoughts. Sometimes it’s so hard to see myself graduating and I’m just wondering why I’m trying to avoid the inevitable. 

But on the other hand. I still enjoy being alive. I realise that for me it’s just the stress getting to me. I hope you feel better soon. Depression sucks. But it’s something we battle. It does not define us. "
"I stay up late at night, not because I enjoy being awake, but because I dread the next day.",I love sleeping. It's the waking up part that sucks. Do you ever feel better when you get enough sleep? I'm generally a wreck but if I don't get enough sleep it's even worse.
"When you have depression, a very good day is a happy persons normal day.","Reminded me of this http://imgur.com/NQ4ElXW

My parents and only sister died in a car accident. I am 20.,"I'm so sorry for your loss. 

Try not to push your friends away. Confide in them, and try to maintain your relationships. Isolating yourself will only make things harder for you, not easier. 

Losing your parents and sibling is devastating, but dont let it defeat you. But dont forget about the other people who love you too. 

I wish there was something I could say to help you, but there really isnt. Dont let this defeat you, you will be strong enough to handle the pain soon, I promise."
Is there anyone here who is about to write a text post about their problems but then erases it because you feel like you're unnecessarily whining?,[deleted]
Do you ever feel ashamed to be in public?,"Sometimes ashamed sometimes embarrassed but I think it’s more I want to get away from the judgement and bad looks. I feel safer in private but also hate myself for being ugly (like when I see videos of normal looking people and remember how ugly I am)

I just feel hated and disrespected. 
For some reason being ugly is a sin and makes you get treated awfully."
Does anyone use video games as a form of escapism?,It sure helped to mask the sounds of my parents arguing. It helped to serve as a surrogate for relationships and a distraction from witnessing my future dissipate into nothing.

Litter saved my life.,Good on ya for cleaning that shit up too!
My. Mental. Illness. Does. Not. Make. Me. Weak.,"This is why I haven’t opened up to my family about my depression. They’re super conservative.

I love them so much, but sometimes it’s like an uphill battle with them."

"First thought after waking up: ""I can't wait to go back to sleep""",Can't wait to not wake up. 
I’m going to a psychiatrist for the first time and I’m a little freaked,"The psychiatrist won't prescribe you any medications without hearing you out first, unless there's some immediate need, like you are having panic attacks or something that's making day to day life impossible for you and even then you are not obligated to take them, you can try working with them for a different treatment if you think is best.

Primarily they may ask basic questions like why are you there, why did you feel the need to seek medical help and how do you feel about it and in general. Don't be afraid to speak your mind.

You need to know that no medical professional will try and do anything against your will. They're there only to help you find the best course of treatment for you based on your needs and desires. 

Hope I could be of help and hope you find what you need to feel good and comfortable. And remember you can always seek other professionals for a second opinion."
Anyone else feel like they will inevitably end up killing themselves?,"I very clearly remember lying in bed as a \~7-year-old thinking to myself that I won't live to see the age of 13. Now I'm in my mid-twenties, surprised that I'm still here, and in a worse place than ever."
Spending New Years in the hospital,Hey. Getting help is the best way to start the New Year. Intensive therapy was the best thing I ever did. Keep an open mind and be willing to try. The tools you’ll learn will help.

Does anyone feel like they’re not going anywhere in life?,"Yes. I'm 19, lost my job, and sit at home (I still live with my parents), wasting away my time on this earth playing video games and jerking off. I fucking hate my life.

Edit: Thanks for the replies everyone. I does make me feel better. At least a little bit."
Wife is dying and I feel so lonely.,You should really think about joining a support group or seeing a therapist. You need to someone who can talk with you about this. I'm so sorry you're going through this and I'm so sorry your wife if going through this. I can't imagine how she or you feel right now. It's devastating 
That fucked up moment when you realize even suicide is not an option.,"Stuck in a job you hate, with no energy to look elsewhere.
The friends you have are slowly slipping away and you don know how to get them back.
And after all that, you just keep going... I know that feel.
If you can, get counselling. Or someone you can just talk to. Better than stewing in your own brain."
"My ex texted me ""I don't give a fuck even if you die""",That last line made me smile. Thank you :)
Meeting a former bully,That's cool. A lot of the time bullies grow out of that behavior.
I don't see the point in being honest about my feelings with my family if all they will do is be angry at me for feeling the way I do,"I'm always shocked that this is a thing. I can't understand why people get angry when their relatives are sad. I'm at a point where it's not really hard for me to open up about my depression but I can't count the number of times my mother lashed out at me asking me if I'm ok and I just answer no.

Maybe people feel helpless and think that violence in their words or attitude is their last resort but it's just awful and disrespectful. I feel you, it can be hard but sometimes it can be helpful to communicate less with your family and/or try to chose the times you have to be in contact with them."
It's so hard to get out of bed.,I know that feel. It doesn’t help that my bed is super comfortable ;-;
"My depression makes me want to be alone, and makes me lonely.","That's the thing about depression. It makes you want to be alone and then that loneliness makes the depression worse. Talk about a terrible vicious cycle. I've had depression and doing little social things really does help, despite the fact that it's almost impossibly difficult. "
"No matter how early I go to bed, when I wake up it feels like my battery is at 50%, feeling like I want to stay forever in bed, so I try to rest a little bit and stand up after several minutes.",I got a blue light filter for my phone now I can chill and read my phone in the morning without hurting my eyes. It helps me wake up quite a bit. 
does anyone else get jealous?,"Yes, it happens to me a lot of time, I think it is normal. I am always comparing myself to other people and they all seem more talented and successful than me.  I am often envious of other people’s achievements, it is difficult for me just to be happy for them. I feel awful about it but I cannot help it. "
Who else is spending NYE alone?,"New Years has now passed in NZ.

I spent it alone.

I did drive to a decent spot to watch the fireworks, but they're a distant memory already. Jesus fireworks can be underwhelming.

I don't know what's worse - spending NY alone, or spending it with people and being miserable anyway. I've done both. New Years IS overrated.

Happy New Year :)"
"I get really uncomfortable when people ask me ""Where do you see yourself in 5 years?""","My first thought is always ""dead"" so then I have to come up with some bullshit answer "
I forgot where I live,I’m really sorry. I can’t imagine how hard and scary that must be for you. Maybe start to write down important addresses in your phone. Hugs.
I wish suicide was easier,"I wish suicide was less tabu and more relatable. When I talk someone about suicide they point out those people as sick and helpless, when sometimes only asking and being around that person could have an extremely positive impact in them to get out of the darkness.

You should talk totally open with a close person, there's always someone that will listen to you and understand your situation, as cheesy as it sounds you will feel better. You will die eventually one day, so don't rush it, experience the ride till it goes, use the suicidal thoughs as something  to take things less seriously and just live life as a stupid game."
Did you ever feel like your depression is fake?,I feel like I'm lying to give myself an excuse to be lazy and antisocial. You're not alone
I won't commit suicide but I wouldn't mind dying,This is so relatable 
Anyone else feel like they're just living the same day over and over?,[deleted]
I dont want to kill myself. I just don't want to exist,"Sadly, this means being killed without asking for it. or suicide without the mental or physical pain. in many religions, apparently it is a sin to voluntarily end your life, but not if it is ended for you, without your input. I understand your misery, I feel it often. I'm not sure what else to say at this point. One of my greatest flaws is my memory, probably adhd."
A letter to my daughter -from my depression,"Damn, this made me tear up. Please stay strong and keep fighting!"
Do you ever read/watch a really good story about friendship or love and then get sad because you realize its probably never going to happen to you?,"So I believe one driving force in depression is a difference between expectations and reality.  Movies and TV shows are fake! The people are fake and you should look at it like someone is trying to convince you into an exaggerated ideal. This is like when you see commercials of skinny people happily eating fast food or healthy looking people advertising heart medicine.  

Not to say that friendship and love don’t exist but sometimes tv shows and movies are unrealistic, over the top, and function to fuel feelings of depression and inadequacy."
Does anyone have a completely normal day but still think of killing themselves?,"Even on my best days where overall I’m happy and content with life, it’s always in the back of my head. "

Depression is humiliating,This really hit the nail on the head for me. I don't think I could have described my depression better. Thank you for posting this!
Is anyone else always tired?,"Yeah. I'm so sorry to hear you're struggling with this too. It's a bit ironic for me, because I'm always exhausted and while at work during the day I would ideally pay lots of money to just be able to go home and go to bed, once I get in bed at night I struggle with insomnia. Anyone else?"
Anyone else feel horrible about wasting their youth?,"I'm 25, so believe me when I say that your 20s can be a very difficult time with depression. That being said, also realize that you're still in your youth. It's not wasted. You still have plenty of time to decide who you are, what you want to do, and where you want to go. Hell, even *I* have time to decide that. Your youth isn't over. So take your time, move one day at a time, and just put one foot in front of the other. Try different things, see what you like. You don't need to commit now. You've got time in your life. You can do this."
Depression and social anxiety have turned me into such an uninteresting person.,"You and me both man. And because we're so uninteresting we have even more difficulty talking to people and making friends, which makes us more anxious and depressed. The cycle repeats. And each time we need to use more energy just to fake personality. Being alone is definitely familiar, but not comfortable. Intimacy is a pipe dream for me."
It came back. It always comes back.,"Man, I have said this exact thing to myself so many times. I have finally concluded that my depression will never go away, that I’ll have fleeting moments of peace but that this disease will always be with me. The thing is, you get to a place where you’re sick and tired from the depression, but also sick and tired of fighting it. 

I’ve tried therapy, counseling, every medication known to man, and nothing has ever fully healed me of the pain."

"You know what kills me about being depressed, and how people view me/us? Please read this. Directed to all of you.","I'd love to share my life if I could direct someone down a better path in life. I've done, seen, or been through so much in my life. I know depression and the darkness some of us lurk within. I lurk this sub a lot. I find a lot of encouragement from the words of others. We will overcome our hurdles and succeed. Where else can we go? Most of us are already at the bottom in one sense or another. Up is the choice we have. I'm not giving up on myself! Hope this inspires someone!! 
Edit: Words "
I've skipped work and laid in bed for 3 days straight. I don't know what to do. I just have no motivation to get up in the morning.,"Sunlight. Physically pull yourself out of bed and go for a walk. Sit in the sun. I don't care if you're showered or in sweats... just get outside. Being stuck in bed gets stuffy and overwhelming. If you can manage to just move, get the blood flowing, soak up some vitamin D? It'll help. Trust me.

After that? Small tasks. Shower. Eat. Clean a dish. Clean them all. Clean a room! Do some laundry! Self-care can do loads for energy and motivation. Start small and build momentum!

You can do it! "
"I realised depression makes me only try to re-live old memories, and never new ones.","I think that when we're depressed we so desperately want to go back to before we were depressed. I definitely find myself doing the same thing. I love when something I'm doing reminds me of a happier time in my life. I hope that you can find something new worth your interest. I know it doesn't seem like it when you're depressed, but there's so much out there. "
I can't kill myself because of my cat.,"I'm getting a cat very soon. I know she'll serve the same purpose. The only problem is that if she ever scratches the furniture, my mom will get rid of her because household possessions are more important than my happiness. "
I graduated from college,Congrats! That's gotta be hard af to do when you suffer with depression. Props! What's next?
I can’t “do” self care,"Try setting small goals. Like cleaning only glasses. Then take a break or be done.  Take time to appreciate that you were able to do the task and how you feel better that it’s done. Don’t focus on anything else that needs to be done. Only the one task and reward yourself. Allow yourself to listen to a song or watch a YouTube video or play with your dog.  Eventually, it won’t seem like such an unattainable mountain.  It’s so hard sometimes but appreciate small things you do and soon you’ll realize how many amazing things you do each day."
I’m ready to kill myself. But thank you all.,I want to to give you a hug.
Sleep is the best part of the day,I feel same. I don't even remember dreams. Waking up is hardest part of day then.
I couldn’t kill myself tonight.,"It takes more courage not to pull the trigger, and your hesitation must mean something, like you have some other reason to be here"
"31 and scared. No career, no friends and no girlfriend.","I think I am in the same boat as you.  I just turned 30 a few months ago and still have the same basic hopes and aspirations as my 16 year old self which is basically to get a gf and get laid.  I disgust myself just saying that at this age.  in 2017 I lost my dad to cancer and he was the last person keeping me afloat mentally.  My sister passed away of a heart attack at age 23 back in 2011 and I had previously lost my mom to cancer in 2001. I have a vision disability so getting out and meeting people is difficult. 

 I used to go everywhere with my dad in the summers in my 20s.  He was all I had.  The only friends I have now are married with kids and I'm literally the same person I was in high school.  I was bullied quite a bit in high school and elementary school leading to social anxiety and this has caused me to perceive any social interaction from people roughly my age as them trying to start shit with me.

I'm glad you still have your parents.  Family really helps a lot

I think there's a condition for what we have not sure if it also applies to you but maybe we have peter pan syndrome.  Basically it's the inability to embrace adult responsibilities and be stuck in a state of perpetual childhood or adolescence"
Anyone else feel like your “friends” aren’t really your friends at all?,"I think people without depression find a certain comfort in having an array of surface friends or acquaintances. With depression, these people are often toxic unintentionally or not. "
3 years ago I nearly killed myself. 2 years ago I posted some drawings here. Now I have some more.,"This is one of the best representations of depression I've experienced. 

Describing it as a group of monsters that have phases of coming and going. Coming in and out of depression always seems to be a series of gradually increasing peaks and valleys.

Also the sick paradox of feeling envy at other peoples progression in life (not even successes) despite the fact that you have no drive or care enough about yourself to even eat a proper meal today.

I have a job for extra money, I'm going to college and have been doing great as far as GPA goes, and I'm moving into my first apartment on Saturday.

In theory, my life should be great. If you were on the outside looking in, I should have nothing to complain about and should just be ecstatic because I'm luckier than others. 

Yet here I am, always feeling... nothing. I'd be sad about it if I could feel anything but numbness anymore.

So please know that you're not alone in feeling like this. Depression doesn't care if you have it all; it crushes you regardless."

Does anyone else retreat into their own self made fantasy's?,"/r/MaladaptiveDreaming

Maladaptive daydreaming (compulsive fantasy) is a term first proposed by Eli Somer, Ph.D...to describe a condition in which an individual excessively daydreams or fantasizes, sometimes as a psychological response to prior trauma or abuse. This title has become popularly generalized...to incorporate a recently described syndrome of immersive or excessive daydreaming which is specifically characterized by attendant distress or functional impairment, whether or not it is contingent upon a history of trauma or abuse."
Anyone else get annoyed by relatives who think that finding religion will help your depression?,Yup. That's my parents. Sucks ass.
It’s 3am,"I found some methods of making yourself tired/distracted help.

Try going through each letter of the alphabet, thinking of as many words as you can for each letter before moving on. Between each word, wait 10 seconds. It’s bound to make your brain tired and you’ll just give up and pass out. Good luck."
Depression has turned me into a mean person.,"Same. At first it started off as just mild irritability, but now I turn into a massive dick for the smallest of reasons. I'll argue just to argue and after want to say sorry so bad but I'm filled with shame for how much of an ass I've become. "
you ever feel like your entire existence is wasted potential and you never became the person you were supposed to be?,"I think it’s worse knowing you became exactly who you were supposed to be. A blip in history to be loved by few, known by some and not even a vague thought to anyone else. Completely forgettable. No one. "
One of the most frustrating things about depression is how much of an idiot you become the longer you're depressed,[removed]
"People mourn you if you kill yourself and ask what they could've done to prevent it, yet they treat you like a pariah if you attempted to kill yourself and failed.","Your successful suicide attempt confirms the severity of your struggles and problems whereas not succeeding bears one to question as to whether or not your problems were serious at all. 

A quote by Albert Camus on suicide from *The Fall* comes in mind.

""MEN ARE NEVER CONVINCED OF YOUR REASONS, OF YOUR SINCERITY, OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR SUFFERINGS, EXCEPT BY YOUR DEATH. SO LONG AS YOU ARE ALIVE, YOUR CASE IS DOUBTFUL; YOU HAVE A RIGHT ONLY TO THEIR SKEPTICISM."" "
Depression has turned me into a fucking idiot.,"What I hate is how it made me loss my ability to express myself properly. I'm stuttering, I'm trailing off, I can't put a proper sentence together. This is even worse when someone asks me something unexpected (for example, surprise small talk during interactions with cashiers.) 

edit: I accidentally a word, and I'm not even surprised."
"""Sleeping is nice because you're not actually dead and you're not awake so it's a win-win situation""","I kind of agree, except that the time between falling asleep and waking up feels instantaneous, so I don't really like sleeping. It's like fast forwarding to the next day. When I stay up late, it's procrastinating dealing with the next day."
I'm depressed because I'm lonely. And I'm lonely because I'm depressed.,[deleted]
Depression has changed my memory-- has anyone else experienced this?,"I have forgotten entire events , entire people I've known for years . I don't remember much of college at all. It's almost to the point I'm not sure it happened "
Does anyone feel like they aren't good enough to date someone?,"My exact sentiments for my current crush. She's the prettiest girl that I've ever seen: 12/10, smart, elegant, witty, funny. Man, just the thought of her smiling makes me melt. And here I am, smothered with emotional baggage(s), boring and unattractive."
I’m a deeply depressed mental health professional. Does that make me a hypocrite?,Many of your colleagues are in the same boat
"A guard on World of Warcraft told me, ""May your blades never dull,"" and it was the nicest thing anyone said to me today.",It's why we escape into them.
The only reason I wont kill myself is because I don't want to make my mom cry.,That's the reason most depressed people don't actually go through with it. It was my reason. It means you're a decent person who cares about others.
Nobody thinks depression is serious until suicide happens,"Hate to say it. Even after suicides and suicide attempts, people don't take depression seriously. "
You guys prevented me from committing suicide yesterday. Thank you.,Sending you love <3
Yesterday a random girl on campus hugged me and I felt much better,[deleted]
Is anyone else thinking of killing themselves after their parents die?,"I've had this plan for many years now. As soon as they're gone, I'm out."
"i know what i have to do to get better; however, i don’t have the motivation nor concentration to do it",Yes. Me. That is me. This post honestly made me breath a  slight sigh of relief because it's not an easy thing to talk about and I don't want pity so I never bring it up. I know it sucks but it's kinda nice knowing you're not the only one who feels like this. 
"""I'm just tired,"" has become my catchphrase, and a pretty huge lie, at this point.","Yes I do the same thing. Combined with resting bitch face, people always ask me what's wrong. It's actually so tedious and I feel so self conscious and guilty then when I am reminded I am not acting ""normal"". Then I feel so angry that there is this constant pressure to maintain some bullshit facade is happiness/energy all the time!! Like fuck just mind your own business! It's kind of nosy on behalf of randoms to be questioning your state of being, like they don't actually want to know the truth of course, so we have to give them the stupid ""tired"" response. "
Who else lives their life in a fantasy world?,"Escapism is a powerful drug, I spend every moment I can in video games. If I could live in a video game I probably would. Real life just can't compete..."
Do you guys ever feel ashamed for having depression?,Some of my family members just think I'm a lazy piece of shit which is exactly what I am but I don't like having it thrown in my face.
"My mom asks ""Don't you get tired sitting around everyday doing nothing?"" I do. I want to do something, but I just can't be bothered.",[deleted]
The scariest part is when depression becomes so normal you forget what happiness really felt like,"""Depression's like a big fur coat, it's made of dead things but it keeps me warm."""
Anyone else constantly check their phone even though you never receive anything?,Just did... I do it every day... no one takes the time to message me first. :( I'd cry but I'm numb
Brilliant Mind?,"ITT: The clinically depressed berate another clinically depressed poster for daring to suggest that he or she may be of exceptional intelligence, thereby deepening his or her sense of worthlessness, because fuck you that's why."
Does anyone else feel guilty about being depressed?,"Oh yes, definitely!  Then again, what _dont_ I feel guilty about haha"
The only messages I receive is from automated apps.,And I have more messaging apps than people to message! :)
I just showered. Tomorrow I start a new job. Feeling hopeful.,"Good luck tomorrow! I start a new job at a hospital in the morning too, so I am feeling the nerves, but this sounds like a good opportunity for you. Keep your head up. "
"Frustrated by the phrase ""happiness is a choice""","Happiness is a choice if you’re generally happy by default. For people with depression and anxiety... no matter how much they try depression keeps nagging at it.,, pulling it back... until the cause of your depression is fixed. Happiness is not a choice for depressed people."
I did it guys.,"Good job mate. I feel you. Something similar here. However, dont go too much ahead of yourself. Play the long con and even if she is not interested as much as you are. Remember the moment she gave you her number and try it until it lands :)"
I'm just here,Same here. I feel like I am just pretending to be a person. I don’t actually care about my career or education- just pretending because society says I need to do those thing
I want to sleep so I don't have to be awake yet also sad because it'll make tomorrow arrive sooner,"Same here, in the morning all I want is sleep. At night all I want is to stay awake."
"plenty of people have told me ""I'm here if you need to talk"" yet I'm sitting here and I can't think of anybody I'd be comfortable taking to at the moment.","I understand. Sometimes it's easier to talk to strangers. At least for me,  part of my depression is the guilt of feeling like my illness is a burden on those that love me."
I feel like a background character in everybody else’s life,"I swear, if God exists I swear to him, if Goddess exists I swear to her that this pierced my heart all the way to end but I can't see no blood around my chest.

I swear to everything this is me and I know this resembles many of you.

It's like we are in this TV show where we are called once in every 1-2 months for a single episode which consists maximum of 3 minutes of us in total, in which we are portrayed as nice people, us giving advice to everyone whom approach us, friends and family alike but we are never happy ourselves, when the episode ends and people celebrate whatever the accomplishment they have, we are never in the image.

It's tiring, seeing people having girlfriends, boyfriends...going out almost every weekend having the time of their lives, making memories, crushing stereotypes....being happy and here we are man, browsing reddit just to find people like us whom truly understand us. 

Even tho we are alone, we have each other...let's endure this together. "
I understand now what my neighbor said to me years back,"i found myself the same way through my mid 20s. watched people move on, go places...etc. and at 27, i woke up, and said fuck this. im going to start doing shit, whether it be me with or without people, cause that's what i want. it all starts with you, and what you want to do. I've never been one to wanna stay stagnant in a shitty place, even through social anxiety, depression, and panic/anxiety attacks...I've pushed myself to not become agoraphobic. i was that way until 27, and since I've been more places and seen more shit, granted alone, but at least I could appreciate it. at least I could say i had  a good time, with no one to fuck it up with criticism or cynicism or outright being an asshole. your life should be about and for you, on your terms. this was all just what I did, to escape the monotony of bs...along with deleting my social media. I have reddit, and use my free time to play video games, write, make music, and tend to my car. everything works out, but one day at a time. and it all starts with you bud.  pm me if you ever need a friend to listen, cheers."
Feeling like I'm faking depression,Depression conditions you to think the worst about yourself - this is your depression talking.
Does anyone just want to move away and never look back? Just disappear from your current existing life,"Yup. Without actually logging it, I probably spend equal amounts of time between this sort of thought, wanting to just be dead and gone, and wanting to, somehow, find a way for my present life to work out. 

But, I’ve had -some- experience testing out this course of action, and, the problem that keeps coming up is that, no matter where I go, there I am. I’ve lived several places in the US, with new or mostly new circles, have lived overseas a couple of times, have traveled a number of other places, etc. I’m still me and I’m still not fixed. "
"For anyone going through a break up, here's a quote from South Park (of all places) that helped me a lot.","That's a beautiful quote :)

But my depression is not like that. It's kind of sadness that kills your hunger for life and love until you're so numb you don't even feel that sadness anymore, let alone beauty of it or anything else."
My BF is cleaning his car and it's a big deal to me.,"That is AWESOME!! Coming from someone who has dealt with major depression for 13 years, that’s amazing. It probably wasn’t easy for him to do it either. When he’s done, ask him how it went, how he feels, etc. make him feel really really good about it :)"
I am so lonely,You honestly just read my mind. I came on here to say something like that.
I made my bed,I recently washed my sheets for the first time in...a long time. And it felt amazing to lie down in them and be clean. It's the little steps that can sometimes make the biggest difference. It doesn't sound stupid and I'm proud of you
tfw you cannot function and have an intense fear of failure so you skip all your classes and spend your days in bed hoping for some kind of miracle,"I did this too, literally couldn't get out of bed because I was tired. From nothing, really, I didn't work out, I didn't party, I was just super depressed. It helped going outside for a walk, even just 20 minutes of walking outside makes a difference."
You know you're depressed when...,"The sinking feeling of watching your life go by and thinking of the regrets we will have later in life due to depression now. 
It sucks. :/"
"Does anyone else feel like you want people to care but when they do, you feel embarrassed and try to act like everything's okay?",I totally get this. I think it's mainly because I don't feel like I'm worthy of attention and I feel guilty that I'm inconveniencing other people with my problems when they probably have enough of their own to deal with already.
Depression in its simplest form.,"And if you do nothing, you're going to have a bad time. "
Does anyone else feel “casually suicidal”?,"All the time. It’s on my mind for what feels like every waking moment, and for a long time I thought it was normal. But one day, I spoke to a friend about it, and I realized, wow something is terribly wrong with me. The suicidal urges and ideation just became so frequent and nonchalant that it felt casual. "
It makes me fucking angry,Yet people tell us to keep trying. They don't how difficult it is to go through this shit all the time.
When I say 'I'm tired'..,"I love it when I've been in bed the whole weekend, and someone tells me I need to get more rest..."
"Does anyone else have unprovoked, ""casual"" suicidal thoughts?","Reading this made me realize how many times I have ""casual"" suicide thoughts daily. It's kind of mind blowing, actually.

You're not alone. Trust me. There's a lot of us out there that are willing to help, or even just listen."
Does anyone else feel like they don't exist in anyone elses mind unless you're standing right in front of them?,"Yeah. 
I know that I don't mean anything to anyone. I've given up on making friends because I know they'll just get bored of me. I'm not setting myself up for that pain ever again."
I can't kill myself because I'll cause grief to others. Atleast this way I'm the only one who's suffering.,"I hear you. The only reason I haven't blown my head off is bc 1) my Dad would die from grief of my death and 2) the financial burden of my debts/funeral services would be overwhelming. So we're stuck here, trying to eliminate the blow our absence will cause. "
So it's a Sunday morning and I'm going to go to a coffee shop on my own,[deleted]
"I hate when people say ""if you're having depressed/suicidal thoughts, reach out and talk to someone!""","> They said the same old platitudes that everyone has heard a million times. ""It gets better"" ""take it day by day"" ""lots of people care about you"" etc. 

We sympathize with your frustration.  That's why generic uplifting messages like ""it gets better"" are against the posted rules here.  

I don't think it's necessary to talk to a therapist, but I think it usually is helpful to talk to someone with some real understanding, empathy, and wisdom.  Unfortunately, those qualities are so little valued in some circles that people don't even know how to identify individuals who possess them.  In most places these days, professional therapists are the closest thing most people have to a ""village elder"".

Does anyone else not remember the majority of their childhood?,I didn’t even have a bad upbringing and I can’t remember a thing from... god maybe around 13? 
Does anyone else procrastinate to a ridiculous degree?,"Been exactly the same during the past semester. Fortunately, I was able to pass majority of my credit hours despite my terrible procrastination. I don’t know if it would help, but my mantra has been “better to do one simple thing than nothing at all”

It’s worked for me as it allowed me to slowly chip away at tasks that seemed terribly insurmountable and impossible to start on. "
Does anyone else feel like there getting stupider?,"I've totally felt something similar. I think it's mostly my recall has gotten worse, I used to be able to remember things really quickly and accurately, but lately I feel so fuzzy and blank and like I can't think critically about the same things anymore. New information kind of seems to just slip by and I don't retain it will anymore. Hope this helped you out, thanks for sharing. "
My girlfriend took her own life today. I don't know how to handle this.,"This may come off a little selfish, but I think it needs to be said.

I am a depressed girl who has been dating my boyfriend for five years. There have been many times where I've said to myself, ""this is it. I'm done."" Even as extremely recently, I have been thinking that. But I read your post in my boyfriend's voice, which is mortifying to me and a reason why I felt compelled to post.

This opened my eyes to true care for another human being. Your post enabled me to see the other side, what the people who are most important to me would think if I did the unspeakable. It's heart wrenching, and because of your post I never want to put the people I love into that situation. Your girlfriend is not a bad person for putting you into that situation, but your post may have saved another life. I'm sure it's more than just who feels this way as well.

Please know that her actions are in no way your fault. Please know that she didn't do what she did because she didn't love you, I bet she thought a lot of the opposite -- *I don't deserve a great guy like him, he deserves to be happier, and will be without me.* Please know that you will get past this, you will live *for* her, and that you will do the things in life that her mental illness wouldn't allow her to do. 

I can't even possibly imagine the pain you're going through. But please be strong in these times so you have the ability to live on. Trust me -- you don't want to be a regular on this subreddit!"
Do you guys ever have random short bursts of crying that only last for a few seconds.,I can't even cry anymore.
My Wife Killed Herself Last Week.,[deleted]
Do you ever worry that you've been depressed for so long that you don't know how not to be depressed?,"Yep that makes too much sense
I feel like depression has become an integral part of my personality
I feel like I'll never be a fully functional member of society, I'll always be just barely afloat, till I sink."
Told my psychiatrist that I want to be dead,"idk, this method actually works really well for me, it reminds me that suicide is a choice and the fact that i continue not to make that choice is pretty empowering.

it's like when i go on a really difficult hike, i tell myself i can stop and go back down as soon as i reach x amount of steps/distance/time. but when i reach that point, nothing's changed, i've come this far already, i want to keep going until i reach another milestone. this process just repeats itself over and over again, and i always end up at the top of the mountain feeling really proud of myself and happy that i didn't turn around because there's such a kickass view up top...i'm in a pretty healthy place right now but it's strangely comforting to know that i can stop climbing the mountain whenever i want to."
I’m so sick of being ugly,"I have excessive body hair (and chin hair, and a wee tash... Shh) and I feel you - it's a pain in the bum, and I'm guaranteed to have shaving rash and/or stubble on at least one part of my body at any given time! Solidarity, sister ✌️"
Sometimes I just wanna purposefully fail a suicide attempt,"Hey man, I hear you"
"My therapist was like ""fake it 'till you make it..."" I actually was pissed. What the fuck do you think I'm doing? I'm faking it every day. I pretend to care at work, with friends, at the grocery store, etc. I'm sick of having a fake smile on my face.",[deleted]
"The moment I wake up, I'm already looking forward to going back to bed that night.",The bed is my only safe haven and it is also my prison. It is the only place I ever want to be but I feel guilt for not leaving it all day. When I am out I cover my eyes and hope no one sees me. All the time I just want to be back in bed. Fuck what’s happening to me

"I'm almost 24, and have completely wasted the past 5-6 years of my life. I'm in such a dark place and don't know what to do.","For those who read this entire text monster, I would give you a cookie if you were here. I apologize for the rambling, unorganized nature of this post.

Edit: Also, in spite of thread rules, I welcome any and all approaches, including tough love if necessary and productive."
"I was severely depressed during my teen years and at some point I was happy. During that time I would think back and I couldn't believe or understand how I was ever that depressed. Now that i'm depressed again, I don't believe or understand how I was ever happy.","Same though. And I feel I can relate so deeply to depressed people and be truly empathetic but only to this extent when I'm actually depressed. It's really annoying, just when I thought there was one advantage. I turn into even more of a hermit than I am when I'm okay so it makes it hard to actually demonstrate it anyway."
I bet al lot of you are like this aswell as me. ,"Yup that's pretty much me 100% of the time. When I'm with people I want to be alone, when I'm alone I want to be with people.

It's like the grass is always greener on the other side, except that both sides are really just dirt."
"I swear. Every time I feel positive and im talking happily and feel okay, someone says something or replies to me in a way that takes my smile away immediately.","This is so relatable, you don't even know. A majority of the time, I speak based off of how I'm feeling, and if I'm feeling depressed, I don't really speak at all. I just think, and write. So I get so upset when I finally feel like I can say something positive to someone, and they don't acknowledge it. 

They don't realize that I had to fight to finally say something positive, and then I just don't talk at all after that."
"When the little voice says ""I want to die""",Brave cookie <3
Anyone feel depressed because they just don't care about life anymore? That to do anything at all is exhausting mentally and physically,"It's exhausting busy work for nothing.

Another day, another piece of work. Another day online, dealing with people. Another day to worry about dumb appointments, buying groceries, cleaning up. Another day closer to death, winter, America's destructive future. For what? It's all for nothing. It's not worth it in the slightest. No fun to be had. Just waiting out the clock."
Anyone else fantasize about the freedom of suicide but would never actually go through with it?,"I think about it every day, it’s a comfort sometimes to think I have the choice to end it all, but I don’t want to hurt my daughter or family they are the only reason I’m still here"
Being depressed is bad. Feeling guilty about being depressed is the fucking worst.,"You will always measure your problems in your own way.

That doesn't make them any less real or any more fake. The measurements we put into ourselves aren't fair, some people can take an intense amount of grief and trudge on while others can cry about an emotional shove.

You deserve to be able to speak to others about how you feel, about what made you feel as you do now, no matter how inconsequential they are in any grand scheme of things. You're allowed that much, or so I really, really hope."
"I decided to ""come out of the closet"" about suicidal depression on Facebook when Robin Williams died. It went better than I thought it would. My friends were extremely supportive. This is what I posted.",Perfect. Anyone who doesn't have depression should read this.
