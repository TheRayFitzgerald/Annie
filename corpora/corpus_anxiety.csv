""Staying up til 5 AM browsing the internet to distract myself then lying in bed as the sun rose with my heart pounding in my ears, trying to cry or scream or look for some kind of exit from this horrible feeling, but instead just gritting my teeth and violently cringing in the foetal position because of every responsibility I've shirked and every opportunity I've wasted.""

**""Neat, me too!""**"

Drawing I made about panic attacks and anxiety...helps me process everything in a new way,Good job with this. Understanding your anxiety and how it makes you feel is a great way to deal with it.

I WENT TO THE GYM AND I DIDN‚ÄôT DIE!!! (I‚Äôve had public workout anxiety since elementary school),"Way to go!! I know how daunting that can seem, it took me a long time to be able to do a workout outside of my house, let alone on a run or something away from people/medical help. Keep up the good work, and be patient with yourself!"
Might need a pick me up,[deleted]
Anxiety is having a wonderful day ahead of you but not enjoying it because you‚Äôre thinking about that 2 minute phone call you‚Äôll have to make in five days.,Or thinking about an embarassing moment that wasn't even that bad that happened two years ago that no one remembers but you
"i experienced the worst panic attack i‚Äôve ever had. this is my bunny, Chicken, helping me feel better","Been going through a bad breakup as of late. My dog doesn‚Äôt do kisses or pets, but when she sees I‚Äôm crying she comes and makes me hold her paw. "
Service dog senses and responds to owner's oncoming panic attack,I‚Äôll take one please 
When you're calm and relaxed,The moment you become aware you‚Äôre not anxious is when u become anxious again 
Today is a hard day. My cat knows exactly when I‚Äôm having a panic attack and cuddles with me until I calm down. Animals are magical. ‚ù§Ô∏è,Oh my gosh such a sweet kitty
Anxiety is waking up 3 hours before your alarm and not being able to fall back asleep because you're worried you won't be able to fall back asleep.,Or worried you‚Äôll sleep through your alarm
My family isn‚Äôt the most understanding when it comes to my anxiety so I lean a lot on my cats for support. I did some photo art about how I see them.,"beautiful photo üíõ pets are very life giving, they help me too. "

Trying to sleep with anxiety is like trying to sleep with relentless pop up ads in your mind,this is the realest shit that i‚Äôve heard this week
I made a lil comic based on a post I saw here about work while having anxiety. so here it is.,"It's just 5 in the morning and I haven't slept and I couldn't stop thinking about it so I made it and now I think I'll be able to sleep lol. 
Have a good day reddit :)

edit: Thank all you guys! 

edit2: Jeez louise. I feel so inspired and encouraged. Don't knock the power of reddit. You guys have made one of the worst weeks of my life turn into something positive and I seriously love all of you nice little bastards for doing that. 
It's amazing and awful that so many of you feels the same way. If nothing else I'm glad this subreddit is here to bring some community to the people who need it most.

"Does anyone else's anxiety make them waste an entire Sunday and then when nighttime hits, your anxiety ramps up because you know you have to work the next morning?","‚ÄúSunday scaries‚Äù 
I usually use Sunday‚Äôs for cleaning, laundry, food shopping, small errands,and prepping for the week just so I can try and avoid the anxiety."
I FUCKING HATE SOCIAL ANXIETY BECAUSE YOU‚ÄôRE SCARED TO TALK TO PEOPLE BUT ALSO DYING TO TALK TO PEOPLE AND HANG OUT AND RELAX AND HAVE FUN AND NOT BE ALONE AND LONELY AND FEEL LIKE SHIT BUT YOU DO FEEL LIKE SHIT BECAUSE YOU CAN‚ÄôT EVEN RELAX ENOUGH TO TALK TO PEOPLE WITHOUT OVERTHINKING EVERYTHING,"I'm sure you know; but just a reminder that you're definitely not alone. It's like when you get sick and you actually enjoy it because it forces your body and mind to slow down... anxiety is a cunt.

On that note, it is possible(so I've heard, and have seen limited results myself) that it is possible to tame some of these symptoms through cognitive behavioural therapy(you can download an app on your phone), and meditation techniques (:

..The only reason that I've only seen limited results is because I have trouble committing to them."
I know a lot of us take antidepressants for anxiety so here's a map I made about it,The brain zap bay when you miss a dose can get pretty rough
Feeling so proud of: -present me- for going to my exercise class even though I was late and was anxious people would be mad. -past me- for getting up the guts to start going to the class in the first place. That was super scary! Now it‚Äôs a routine it‚Äôs easier to go.,Proud of you!!!!! 
I painted health anxiety... At least how it feels to me.,"I love it. I hate this brand of anxiety so so much because it's so hard to express, no one understands and you can't make them understand. Its so validating to see it expressed creatively."
Just managed to successfully complete a 9 hr shift at work today (I cook at a Pizza Hut) after suffering a panic attack on shift just last Sunday.,Great job! I hope things get easier.
Is this also you? Because this is me.,That's what I've been doing right now. (but I live with housemates) 
Anxiety is sending an email and then not checking your email for 3 days because you're scared of seeing the reply.,Legit me whenever i have to send a work email üò∞
Do what you can with what you have wherever you are.,"I am not usually susceptible to these types of messages, but this one got me in the feels. Thanks OP ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Does anyone else ever take out your ear buds to make sure no one else can hear what you're listening to?,"One time, 13 years ago, I did this to check and a woman near me said, ‚ÄúYes. You‚Äôre bothering me.‚Äù

I have never recovered. üò≠"
"People with a mental illness are not lazy. They have to face an internal battle everyday. And we all know loosing the battle is not an option. We literally have the biggest, most important job possible. Keeping ourselves sane and alive.","""But what if I am lazy and just making up the mental illness as an excuse..."" said his anxiety to his mind.

""Obviously I am a completely worthless bumb, and should just kill myself, acting mentally ill to hide my laziness."" Quipped his depression. 

""Guys the OP might have a point, we do argue a lot, and you depression like to throw the suicide thing on the table a lot."" Said his possibly true inner voice. 

""But whos to say the depression isn't the true inner voice and the inner voice isn't just playing a trick on you trying to get you to stay alive through torture? "" responded what he thought was his anxiety, but was now unsure if it was his true inner voice. 

""Yes obviously you should listen to me and just go step in front of that train tommorow."" Said what might be the true inner voice, or maybe something else entirely. 

""No that's scary! Stay home, in bed."" What fucking voice is that? 

""You're obviously a lazy piece of shit."" Said one of the voices that all bled together in the end. 

*sits in place not making any decisions or doing anything, the world assumes hes lazy, and yet part of him believes it* "
"I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this, but, unclench your jaw and relax your shoulders.",Ugh. I have to remind myself this exact thing like a hundred times a day. I clench my jaw so much that I started getting headaches if I don't catch it.
I love you and hope you are having an awesome day,been doing yoga. it actually kind of helps. 
Does anyone use their phone excessively for hours to distract their brain?,Yes. That or Youtube. I frequently will close Reddit then open it 5 seconds later. I do this with the apps I‚Äôm on a lot.

I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything, I was proud of myself for being brave. Tonight, they offered me the position. I AM A PERSON AGAIN. I AM REAL. I EXIST.",Hey congratulations! But you mattered before this as well. You don't need to have a job to be valid
I DID IT.,"Oh my Goddd!!! Well done, I‚Äôm so happy for you!!"
"Does anyone feel depressed that their anxiety has kept them from experiencing major parts of a ""normal"" life?",That is a very common feeling.  Anxiety does make us withdraw from life.

Anyone ever get a surge of anxiety whenever your phone rings? Every time it goes off I just think ‚ÄúFuck. I‚Äôm in trouble‚Äù.,"Yes.

I hope this can be helpful for those who get anxious. I‚Äôm still learning ü§ûüèº,"Also, limit your time on Reddit. Reddit can be great for a lot of things, but it also is a huge vortex of negativity and judgment. Take a breather from all of that because it doesn‚Äôt represent the real world. "
Went and tried to help my neighbor start his car! Pictured is exactly how I felt!,This comic is great. You are great for trying to help. Everything is great.

Haha"

Like they can just choose not to be bothered by something?","Yeh, I was like this as a teenager, no matter what the problem was if I made it to the weekend I was good. Anxiety started in my early 20's and now it feels like any minor event can send my life into a tail spin."

Congrats!
Anyone else suffer from depression too and have to decide whether or not to drink coffee because it‚Äôs a choice between my anxiety being worse or being exhausted all day?,Even with caffeine I can‚Äôt do more than the bare minimum

"TIL actress Kristen Bell has struggled with and received treatment for depression and anxiety. She said, ""It's important for me to be candid about this so people in a similar situation can realize that they are not worthless and that they do have something to offer."" : todayilearned","I saw a PSA she did where she takes about how her mom and grandmom (edit not grandson) both struggled, too, and when she was a teenager her mom sat her down and was like ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôve struggled and so has your grandmom, so you might too. If you ever feel like life is just too hard - talk to a doctor.‚Äù

Chills every time. I thought it was such a good way to not pathologize every behavior or bad mood but still let someone know that genetics suck and to keep an eye out. "
Unclench your jaw,"Luckily my anxiety has kept me from going to the dentist for years and enabled horrible hygiene so if I clench it hurts. 

Did I win..?"

How many of you guys lurk the anxiety subreddit but don't post/comment?,"Wow! So many people posting for the first time!

I am SO proud of all of you! It takes a lot of courage to start posting. Congrats on taking this step!

And I want to give a shout out to everyone who has upvoted, but hasn't posted! You guys are important, too!

Everyone here, whether you are a lurker, commenter, or poster, regular or someone who just pops in occasionally, is a vital part of this community. Thank you all so much for being here and making this place what it is. We wouldn't be here without you. We're all rooting for you."
"Does anyone get so anxious about class that they don‚Äôt go, but then it makes your anxiety even worse because of the guilt from not going?","It's a vicious cycle. I'm in law school and the amount of stress leading into finals makes me incredibly unproductive and I'm out of days I can be absent from school. Even when I try to relax I feel super guilty about not doing work.

I finally did take a full weekend break last week when a friend of mine came to visit and I was able to relax without freaking out about all the work I needed to do. That break (hopefully) gave me the energy to continue trucking on. 

2 more weeks and my second year of law school is over. Only 1 more to go *sigh*"
"Does anyone else get overwhelmed and anxious as soon as they have a responsibility to fulfil (answering a text, an email, etc.)?",Yep. I'm getting worse as I try to manage my anxiety too. Like I put it off till it's over due even if it is something so simple.
Does anyone else replay their conversation in their heads and worry they said something that pissed the other person off?,"All the time yes and it‚Äôs not just talking ,it‚Äôs when I text as well"
"I‚Äôve failed my license test 4 times because I have test anxiety, especially when someone‚Äôs sitting next to you writing notes but today I PASSED! It was so scary but I finally did it (I‚Äôm 21)",Congratulations! üëèüëèüëèüëèüéäüéâüéäüéä. I've had anxiety too when taking both tests (written and driving) and got my license when I was 23.
I‚Äôm anorexic and have several anxiety disorders and I went grocery shopping by myself for the first time in 6 months! ‚ò∫Ô∏è,"Good job!

I haven't grocery shopped proper in a month. "
Today I gave a presentation to a room of 30 people. My voice broke a lil and I was kinda shaky but i still managed to not completely lose my voice (usually happens) and I‚Äôm proud of myself ü•∫,One of the hardest things to do. Good job on being brave!
Took a huge step. Went to see a therapist today. Had a panic attack while leaving went there crying and all. But I did go.,Wow congrats on the progress you made to finally see a therapist. Bravo! I hope future sessions will be better for you. All the best to your therapy sessions.
Climbing the panic attack mountain (art),"I get these almost every day especially when I‚Äôm not distracted or engaged in an activity, especially when driving. I think it‚Äôs due to boredom or something. 

Anyways can confirm this is how it feels (at least to me), especially the dying part. Awesome pic thanks for sharing!"
Skipping classes for my mental health...which impacts my grades...which impacts my mental health.,Exactly what happens to me. I did it on school and now I do it with work...
"understand this: you can sound confident & have anxiety. you can look healthy but feel like shit. You can look happy & be miserable inside. you can be good looking & feel ugly. so be kind, because every person is fighting a battle you know nothing about","So true! Especially when dealing with customer service people. You have no idea what they are dealing with on a regular basis. Jerk supervisors, annoying coworkers, other shitty customers. Plus whatever is going on in their personal lives. But they are forced to wear a smile and be super nice no matter what they're dealing with. Some are fighting back tears their entire shifts and drive home crying, and all for shitty pay with little appreciation.

As someone who not only deals with anxiety and works customer service I try my best to give back a little bit. Not just with a decent tip but saying things like ""you're amazing!"", ""thank you SSOO much!"", and sometimes, when I'm really happy with the service ""I love you!"" You'd be amazed the smiles you get from these small words."
Best explanation I've read about how dealing with both depression and anxiety feels... [x-post r/depression],"I've always thought of it like this:

Depression is your whole body slowing down (no energy, eat less, sleep more, etc). You're get-up-and-go is gone. 

Anxiety is your mind sped up. (more thoughts, more worries, more fears, etc)

When you add slowed body to sped up mind everything becomes off kilter and unbalanced. You feel like you're fighting yourself at every moment and getting nothing accomplished despite so much energy being exerted. 

"
"My biggest fear is that my anxiety will always keep me in my ""safe zone"" causing me to live a life of mediocrity that I will one day really regret.","Anxiety is the disease of broken dreams 

It will prevent you from going to college  or doing well in school 

It will prevent job interviews, meetings, etc

It will hinder you from meeting others and dating 



Make the decision today: give in to the anxiety and remain in the safe zone, or challenge it and routinely put yourself outside of your comfort zone 

Do one thing each day that scares you."
"Anxiety isn‚Äôt cute, anxiety is thinking someone died because they haven‚Äôt messaged you in a day.","When my husband isn't home by like 30 minutes past when he usually gets off work I start thinking he's died in a horrible car accident on the way home.  But I'm afraid to text or call him in case he checks his phone while driving and gets into a horrible car accident and dies.

He's come home to me pacing a rut in the living room floor too many times, and in the last couple weeks has started texting me the minute he knows he might not make it out on time.  I feel like a crazy person, but I also appreciate it so so much."
"Anxiety didn't win, I'm graduating high school in 4 hours!",im so proud wow this is an achievement!
"PSA: NEVER let a bad day/week/month convince you that you haven't made any progress. You're better off now than you were a year ago, and you will persevere further.","I'm more depressed then anxious, but use video games to trick myself into a sense of progress. I may not have gotten the dishes done yesterday, but I did defeat the Hornet in Hollow Knight."
Anyone else get anxiety when you notice the slightest change in how someone speaks/treats you,"yes. It's part of the illness. The craziest thing is that people with Anxiety live with so much emotion bombarding them all the time and they are dealing with it all the time yet when another person is ""slightly off"" we freak out and blame ourselves. Calm down. People have good and bad days and act accordingly. If someone has a problem with you the protocol is for them to bring it to your attention or suck it up. The end. 
"
"30 minutes after I finished drawing this, I had a major panic attack. Did I just draw my anxiety?",Anxiety does weird things to you. I've very suddenly gotten anxious whenever I see something that has the surreal anxiety driven vibe of nightmares I have had. Maybe drawing it has a stronger effect. 
I always want to post in this subreddit but I know I‚Äôll feel like a failure if I don‚Äôt get upvotes.,I delete so many posts and comments for this reason.  You‚Äôre not alone OP. 
I JUST CALLED INTO A PIZZA PLACE!!!,"As someone who gets bad phone anxiety I can definitely say you nailed it! 

Now go eat your pizza in sweet, sweet victory."
Sending everyone hugs tonight.,"Thank you. The world just seems so overwhelming and awful at the moment. But I know we can get through it, and you can too."
Does anyone else suppress their personality when speaking to new people and end up being a boring shell of a person and having really boring conversations because you don‚Äôt bring any life to them,I definitely feel this. It can be a mix for me though sometimes it‚Äôs a wave of being terrified of people not liking me so I end up as you were describing or I feel as though I‚Äôm putting on a show for everyone.
Anxiety,"I once drew something very similar to this, but obviously not as well. I love that we both came to the same visual description of such a difficult emotion that we all face "
"""Trusting your gut feeling"" is a lot more difficult when you have anxiety.",My gut tells me I‚Äôm having a heart attack almost everyday for months so I don‚Äôt listen to it anymore lol.
Decided to face my fears head on! Went on my first flight since getting PTSD. Was quite concerned about how I‚Äôd cope. But used a new technique. Not so big and scary anymore are ya panic attacks!! Didn‚Äôt panic and feeling so much more confident for the next trip!,Congratulations! Please tell us your secret! :) I'm still housebound from PTSD and panic disorder... I can't wait to be able to do this! Great job!
I'm sure this makes its rounds but still a good share nonetheless üò∫,"Here's to another year of being scared shitless of everything but doing it anyways!

Remember, there's no bravery without fear, keep it up!"
Does anyone else get super sensitive to noise when they‚Äôre anxious?,"Sensory overload. It's pretty common amongst people with anxiety, adhd, and autism to name some common ones. Bonus points if you have more than one"
"Im not stupid, im not unintelligent, im not slow, im just anxious.",Damn I feel this way too much
"This gave me a chuckle today, hope it helps you :)",Only 86 are totally illogical - sounds like a good day :)
"I‚Äôm an italian OCD and anxiety sufferer, and I‚Äôm here to tell you that it‚Äôs going to be okay.","Thank you, i'm in Ohio in the US and we are starting to shut down.  some people are passing this off as nothing and others are taking it seriously.  Myself im trying to stay calm for my family but be prepared.  Thank you again for the good post!"
The side of anxiety most people don‚Äôt understand.,100% know how you feel. It gets so tiring! I don‚Äôt know how to stop doing it.
My moms view on anxiety...,"I think you should make this topic off limits with your mom. She clearly won't change her mind and it'll only upset you to have her go on like this.

Obviously that's easier said than done but it'll be easier if you don't see her in person much."
I spent all bloody day worried about making a phone call. I finally did it and it took 30 seconds to set up a job interview and it went totally fine. Why am I like this.,I hear ya. I can ruin an entire week just thinking about some small task I have to do in 5 days that will end up taking 2 minutes.
You are strong for getting out of bed in the morning when it feels like hell. You are brave for doing things even though they scare you or make you anxious.,"Needed that.
It's been getting tough and sometimes I just think an impending doom will just happen. I worry for the future and the unknown and it has been getting hard with my anxiety/depression.
Going to work has also been increasingly difficult and sometimes I dont know if I can keep going."
I impulsively asked a girl out yesterday IN PERSON. She told me she had a boyfriend but I'm honestly just proud of myself for even doing it.,[deleted]
"Do anyone else just want the day to end, but don't want to go to sleep because you don't want tomorrow to start?",Right! Like the night is an escape from the world and then I fall asleep and the next day has begun with responsibilities and anxiety.
"My anxiety has been reaching new peaks lately, so thought I'd try out one of those ""adult"" coloring books. It has literally been years since I sat down and colored, but I think I've found a new form of meditation.","I'm a little envious.  I find that they actually increase my anxiety.  ""What if I colour it wrong?""  Which is impossible but that's what they make me think.  ""What if I regret colouring it the way I did when it's done?  Then it's gone forever.""  My friend suggested photocopying the pages but then my brain says ""what's the point of buying a colouring book if I don't colour in it?""  And the spiral just continues."
"I have terrible phone anxiety but my favorite aunt/ my moms best friend passed and they spelled my moms name wrong in the obituary, she was so upset she didn‚Äôt even want a copy of it so I called and asked if hey could fix it on their website at least and they agreed. Shaking but happy","You did a great thing today. You saw a problem you could solve, you were terrified but pushed through anyway. That takes courage. Pushing through is the key to beating this thing."
Today my wife and I start marriage counseling. I have hurt her over the years because of my anxiety. I hope I can elevate her and be the best husband I can be. Wish us luck.,"Yay!! You're taking steps to be better and right your wrongs. It wont be easy, but moving forward isnt always. Best wishes."

"Been away from home on an extended work detail and my anxiety and depression have been getting really bad. I've been trying to use Photoshop again (been awhile, 10+ years) in hopes it would substitute for some of my more unhealthy habits. I just wanted to share with some people who share my plight","That's damn good. It's very direct, but still has some subtlety that carries the emotion past the foreground imagery.

If that's the kind of work you used to do, I have no idea why you would stop.

So hey, if you can turn the anxiety and depression into something creative and well executed like that, keep at it.

Really powerful stuff."
"I avoid my responsibilities because of my anxiety, but avoiding my responsibilities makes me anxious.","As a college student, this is my life. It's a vicious cycle that I can only break by facing my responsibilities."
Does anyone feel like your anxiety has made you less intelligent?,[deleted]
If You Need a Laugh - I Drew a Map of Depression and Anxiety,This is fucking brilliant 
Who else gets really nervous when someone is in a bad mood?,Literally first irrational thought is: I bet I'm the Problem
"Please forgive your mind/body for the anxiety, it's doing the best it can given the circumstances.",I don't know why but this post strangely made everything feel a bit more okay. Thank you for posting this :)
Does anyone else feel like their brain just literally searches for any reason to worry?,"Yep. Then I obsess over it, and usually convince myself things will be okay. Then it's anywhere from a few minutes to a few days before my brain finds a new worry/new angle on the old worry and off we go again :("
"I feel good right now. I may or may not feel good tomorrow, but goddamnit I feel good and in control today and I'm proud of that",Yes!! Remember this feeling! It will come again ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Anyone else sometimes get a huge burst of confidence, but then feel like absolute shit later?","Yeah it‚Äôs so weird. Whenever I have that confidence boost I wonder how I couldn‚Äôt have it. How easy it feels to be confident.

Then after a day I‚Äôm on the other side and I can‚Äôt imagine feeling confident. "
I've been struggling with anxiety lately. Wanted to draw how I felt and how I see my own anxiety.,I like the drawing. I wish I had the skills to draw what mine looked like. 
"Had anxiety about going to the post office to ship a package, forced myself to go and realized anxiety just makes everything sound worse than it really is and I‚Äôm proud of myself for going!",I'm really proud of you!!!! It's really hard to push through those feelings of anxiety but you did it!!!! Yay!!!! :) :) :)
"If you‚Äôre looking for a sign, this is it. Everything is going to be okay.",Thanks. Been having a shitty week. I know things will get better tho.
"Does anyone else have trouble falling asleep because every fricking thing you ever ""did wrong"" keeps popping in your head and you are literally ripping yourself apart for all the ""wrongful"" things you did months, even years ago. It's been consuming me lately.","I listen to guided meditation to avoid this because it used to happen to me a lot. 
All i think about is the words the person is saying. "
"Most people are accepting of you having an anxiety disorder, but an unfortunate amount of people expect you to only have symptoms in private.","Has happened a few times, when after a few weeks with reoccurring panic attacks at work, I got told by my boss, who himself has struggled with it, that ‚Äúsometimes we need to leave our troubles at home‚Äù. Kinda bugged me since I tried my best and forced myself to be in a situation where 80% of the time I‚Äôd have a panic attack which led to the point where I couldn‚Äôt even leave the house. Not something you need to hear really. I also often feel guilty when I‚Äôm getting anxious and try to tell someone about it cause I‚Äôm genuinely scared. 

So I‚Äôve kinda started to to act calm in those situations and stay away from people when I can‚Äôt. There‚Äôs a weird uncomfortableness with anxiety, so like you said, people want to be open and show that they care, but it‚Äôs more on paper. But it could also be that if they‚Äôre not used to it they get a bit freaked out cause they don‚Äôt know how to handle it. I often forget to tell people how to deal with panic attacks, or what works for me, even if I‚Äôm close to them. Which could lead to people being more comfortable in those situations. "
A Monday reminder,"A thing thats helped me is thinking of HALT when im not feeling great, unproductive, or in a funk. Consider if you are 

H - Hungry

A- Angry

L- Lonely

T- Tired

Usually pushes me to take a break from what I'm doing. I like it. "
"after almost canceling an interview today due to anxiety, I forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!!!",That's awesome!! I hope you get the job. It sounds like they know you'd be a great fit. Fingers crossed!
Fuck anxiety,F
"Anxiety is like you‚Äôre Spider-Man and your spider-senses are always tingling, even when they shouldn‚Äôt be.","Yes, a perfect explanation! I always say that the part of me that feels when something is wrong or dangerous is broken, but I like this better üòÖ."
"Does anyone else hate when they start talking about something they‚Äôre passionate about, but then start to feel like they‚Äôre being annoying and then stop talking about it?",I feel this. Passion is rare for me so when I do find some I feel this need to share it with people. Not being acknowledged for how and what we feel leaves people like me disappointed and upset at myself.
A friendly reminder.,wow you hit every single nail on the head for me. Thank you for posting this because it genuinely helped me. I‚Äôm going to keep this for the future. 
I look at this when I need a little boost,">maybe

>maybe not"
I hope everyone who reads this has a great day. You matter and are important.,Thanks for the post!
"This subreddit needs more active users, I see and read so many posts here that have no upvotes or comments and it‚Äôs baffling! We are supposed to help one another through rough times. Hope this subreddit‚Äôs community realizes what it needs, a sense of community.",You expect people with anxiety to do that.
Does anyone else get gastrointestinal issues when they are very anxious?,100% yes. It's awful. I'm now at the point where if I get a stomach ache for any reason I'm immediately anxious because I'm connecting the fact that anxiety makes me sick. It's a vicious cycle.
"Does anyone else get ""pee anxiety""? Like, when you know you won't be able to use a restroom for a few hours, you get really anxious about it and end up thinking about needing it the whole time?",Yes. This is me 100% :( and the anxiety makes me actually need to pee. I fear any situation where there are no toilets for any significant amount of time (2 hours +)
"does anyone else‚Äôs anxiety cause them to speak really fast and finish people‚Äôs sentences, leading to really weird conversations that don‚Äôt last long?","I sometimes mumble and finish sentences without being anxious.

 If I'm anxious in conversation I usually don't have anything to say, like my mind stops. I nod, say ""uh-hah"" or ""yeah"" and never come up with decent response. Sometimes I wish I have said something in response because I guess I would form friendships more easily. But i'm very introverted + anxious so...

Do you feel like you pushed people away with your way of talking when anxious?"
I painted this using the titles of some posts here.,This is fucking beautiful. I don't even have the words to say how much I like this. You have a true talent.
"After four years of suicidal ideation, depression, and the worst anxiety I‚Äôve ever known, I graduated college today. Progress is possible, for anyone who needs to hear that right now.","Even though I don't know you, OP, I'm so proud of you. You deserve this achievement. Congratulations!"
Does anybody else's anxiety get soothed by rain and/or stormy weather?,Yes. I prefer when it's cold or rainy so I feel more justified in wanting to bundle up indoors
Just ride it out. This too will pass. It always does. Stop worrying. Let it go. Breathe in and breathe out. Peace and love. My mood is ok. I'm ok.,"This gave me enough motivation to get out of bed today. Thank you, I needed this :) "
To anyone who needs to be reminded- one day you're going to break out of this and enjoy your life the way you've always wanted to.,I don't see a way out
"I KNOW IT'S JUST A VERY SIMPLE THING, BUT I FEEL PROUD FOR NOT HAVING ANXIETY AND PANIC ATTACKS FOR ATLEAST A DAY.",Congrats! üíï
This is helping me get through what's going on in the world right now... and staying off social media.,"Such a great helpful tip! For those who may be on mobile and finding this harder to read oddly enough I have it written out in a 'resources folder' so here's the text below:

---

**Are you hydrated?**
If not, have a glass of water. 

>#

**Have you eaten in the past three hours?**
If not, get some food ‚Äî something with protein, not 
just simple carbs. Perhaps some nuts or hummus?

>#

**Have you showered in the past day?**
If not, take a shower right now. 

>#

**Have you stretched your legs in the past day?**
If not, do so right now. If you don't have the energy 
for a run or trip to the gym, just walk around the block, 
then keep walking as long as you please. If the 
weather's crap, drive to a big box store (e.g. Target) 
and go on a brisk walk through the aisles you normally 
skip. 

>#

**Have you said something nice to someone in 
the past day? 
Do so, whether online or in person. Make it genuine; 
wait until you see something really wonderful about 
someone, and tell them about it. 

>#

**Have you moved your body to music in the 
past day?**
If not, jog for the length of an EDM song at your 
favorite tempo, or just dance around the room for the 
length of an upbeat song. 

>#

**Have you cuddled a living being in the past 
two days?**
If not, do so. Don't be afraid to ask for hugs from 
friends or friends' pets. Most of them will enjoy the 
cuddles too; you're not imposing on them. 

>#

**Have you seen a therapist in the past few 
days?**
If not, hang on until your next therapy visit and talk 
through things then. 

>#

**Have you changed any of your medications in 
the past couple of weeks, including skipped 
doses or a change in generic prescription 
brand?**
That may be screwing with your head. Give things a 
few days, then talk to your doctor if it doesn't settle 
down. 

>#

**If daytime: are you dressed?**
If not, put on clean clothes that aren't 
pajamas. Give yourself permission to wear 
something special, whether it's a funny t-shirt or a 
pretty dress. 

>#

**If nighttime: are you sleepy and fatigued but 
resisting going to sleep?**
Put on pajamas, make yourself cozy in bed with a 
teddy bear and the sound of falling rain, and close 
your eyes for fifteen minutes ‚Äî no electronic screens 
allowed. If you're still awake after that, you can get 
up again; no pressure. 

>#

**Do you feel ineffective?**
Pause right now and get something small completed, 
whether it's responding to an e-mail, loading up the 
dishwasher, or packing your gym bag for your next 
trip. Good job! 

>#

**Do you feel unattractive?**
Take a goddamn selfie. Your friends will remind 
you how great you look, and you'll help fight 
society's restrictions on what beauty can look like. 

>#

**Do you feel paralyzed by indecision?**
Give yourself ten minutes to sit back and figure out a 
game plan for the day. If a particular decision or 
problem is still being a roadblock, simply set it aside 
for now, and pick something else that seems 
doable. Right now, the important part is to break 
through that stasis, even if it means doing something 
trivial. 

>#

**Have you over-exerted yourself lately ‚Äî physically, emotionally, socially, or 
intellectually?**
That can take a toll that lingers for days. Give 
yourself a break in that area, whether it's physical 
rest, taking time alone, or relaxing with some silly 
entertainment. 

>#

**Have you waited a week?**
Sometimes our perception of life is skewed, and we 
can't even tell that we're not thinking clearly, and 
there's no obvious external cause. It happens. Keep 
yourself going for a full week, whatever it takes, and 
see if you still feel the same way then.

"
Is anyone else‚Äôs life just surviving work each day so they can get home and collapse in bed and then repeat,"I try to get through a 10-12 hour day at work and hold on to my sanity just so I can get home and binge/purge food for hours until I'm so exhausted I take my ambien and go to sleep. 
Fucking tragic."
Anxiety/OCD Tattoo 'close X button' to remind myself to treat any unwanted intrusive thoughts as a pop up spam..when you get a pop up spam you dont click on it to read it instead you close out [X].,"I got the ""don't panic"" from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy on my wrist for the same purpose."
Today i turned thirty and instead starting the day with tequila shots i started cleaning and organizing my house... something anxiety has been blocking me from doing... and right now i feel amazing,Good for you!  Remember this feeling and continue to be as productive as you can. Push yourself to not fall back on your same bad habits. 
"Does anyone else get annoyed that the symptoms caused by anxiety are causing more anxiety, but your brain won't accept it's anxiety?",Yep! I was explaining this to a friend just yesterday.  My anxiety makes me feel nauseous and dizzy.  My nausea and dizziness make me anxious. It‚Äôs a vicious circle with no end!!
Do you ever have one of those days where you just want to say fuck everything and just sleep for like a week?,Absolutely. I'm on the verge of it now. But I know it won't help so I'll push through. This time.
"One of the most annoying things about panic attacks: No matter how many times you've had identical symptoms and came out fine, they're still just as terrifying.","Couldn‚Äôt agree more with this! ‚ÄúHey, that pain in my arm wasnt actually a heart attack‚Äù *3 months later, pain in arm* ‚ÄúHoly shit it‚Äôs a heart attack*"
I take my hat off to people who experience anxiety as a daily thing. You guys are true warriors,"It really helps my day to see this post. Due to my anxiety I‚Äôve been having a terrible week, and seeing somebody acknowledge how hard it can be makes me feel a bit better, knowing people don‚Äôt doubt what I go through."
I challenge you all to give me five minutes of your time.,Ooof I needed this. Jaw clenching and tight shoulders are my bad habits!
I don't understand how people work 40+ hours a week for 45+ years of their lives,"Nope, not just you.  Grind away until you die, hope that you don't get sick."
My fitbit today told me I had 70 active minutes. I had none. My fitbit doesn't know I have mad anxiety that makes my heart race as if I'm running for my life. Silly fitbit.,"""Haha,Atleast im not getting fat""

*Cries in 200 BPM* "
Todays 365 days clean of self harm,Yay I‚Äôm so happy for you!! Definitely deserving of those tattoos :)
"Everytime your anxiety gives you shit, remember, it's FAKE news.","Yep! Every time I get those feeling of doom, I would image myself standing in the podium looking down and say ""FAKE NEWS"" with my hand pointing at it. It works, at least for me it does. "
My best friend became a mass murderer. I‚Äôve never been the same since that day.,"Holy shit, BTW, you feeling bad after this means you're a moral emphatic human being, but at the same time, it seems to get into the territory where it is unhealthy. I have no idea, but realize you're NOT at fault here! (also I think your dad is a bit  unempathic here, you have gone though something most people would never have to deal with. And just ""getting over it"" doesn't even help with normal anxiety)  I'm not sure which subreddit would even be useful here.  But knowing Reddit their maybe some niche subreddit for people who had friends who did horrible things. Maybe try to seek other people who were friends with someone who did horrible shit, to learn how they cope and deal with it. "
Does anyone else hate when you have to do something the next day? Like you can‚Äôt be at peace until you get it over with?,"I used to. Here's why it happens and how you can stop it.

The reason why is that you have trained your mind (and in reality, it has been trained by outside forces) to look at future events critically. If you're like me, you think of everything that can possibly go wrong when you go out, you think about hard it'll be, how tired you'll be. What if you miss the bus? What if there's traffic? What if the other person is late? What if what if what if.

What if is the poster child of the anxious thought. It can seem like a good idea, to prepare yourself for the next days tasks, but our problem is that we only ever think *negatively* about the next day.

But if doing things was ALWAYS negative, you wouldn't ever do things. 

So try this instead. Start to visualise what you need to do tomorrow entirely positively. Instead of thinking worst case, start to think best case. Imagine seeing your friend, and they're super happy to see you. Imagine the food you'll eat. Imagine the fresh air, blah blah. Just go through the next days task, imagining it entirely possible.

Anxiety and excitement feel quite similar when low level. So it's possible to reconfigure your mind to interpret that anxious feeling as just being excited for the next day.

After you complete the day, get some post it notes. Write three notes about the things you enjoyed that day, put em in a jar or something. 

Remember, anxiety occurs in your mind, and it colours your reality. But the same can be said for positive emotions. It's why so many people in life talk about it. If you start to think positively, your body will react as if something positive is happening. 

You can do it, you can cope, it's not too much for you! 

If you're still at a point where the anxiety is just too high to do this stuff, don't worry. You might need a little bit of CBT first, I found that helped me a huge amount. You might need to learn and practice some mindfulness techniques and meditation.

But it's entirely possible to rewrite your brain, so don't worry. If you keep going, keep trying, you can make it."
"Does anybody else crave a day home alone, but your anxiety/depressions also gets worse home alone?","You're not alone. I work 6 days a week, always looking forward to that day off but when it's *finally* there, my depression and anxiety hit the hardest. It's very tiring."
Anyone else have constant anxiety rather than attacks?,"Completely my experience. I have panic attacks sometimes but rarely, though when I do have them they're catastrophically bad.

Mine is more as you said, constantly being on edge and sometimes I'll have waves of panic that makes my whole body clench up, my mind races and I get cold. I also constantly focus  on random bodily feelings, aches or pains and worry I'm dying. Good times."
"If you felt awkward today, I want to congratulate you...",Thank you so much for this. I was doing really well and then got stuck in traffic on my way home and gave myself a lovely little anxiety attack. 
"Be gentle with Yourself today, you're doing the best you can. <3",Sweetest thing i've heard today so far
"Does anyone else constantly feel like the ""pity friend"" and like everyone you know is closer to each other than to you?",Wow you just described how I feel to a T.
"If you want to say ""Thank You,"" don't say ""Sorry.""","I get what you are saying, it actually annoys people around me that I say sorry for everything, it actually a second word for ok in my case

But I feel like the first one is wrong. If you are late, you have to say sorry even if the other one will understand, it's just ... wrong to not do that for me ( and probably why I'm here )"
"This time last year I couldn‚Äôt leave my bedroom because of anxiety, today I talked myself down from a panic attack during a surgical procedure.",So proud of you! This is amazing. So glad you fought your way to get to where you are 
"Keep getting brainzaps, sometimes so bad all I can do is grip my head. They're so hard to explain so I tried to draw it.","Oh god, I remember getting these. My sympathies, OP. Are you on prescription medicine? I think that's what caused mine."
YESTERDAY I HAD NO ATTACKS! LET'S GO BABY!,Congratulations! Every step counts!
"Today, at 22 years old and after years of panic disorder and anxiety, I applied to college for the first time.","This is so awesome, go you! I dropped out of high school, got my GED, nearly flunked my first foray into college. Got my shit sorted and under control, went back at 30, graduated at 33 and then completed two master‚Äôs after. IT CAN BE DONE! You are amazing and you will crush it!"
Does anyone just randomly start thinking about bad shit that happened years ago?,It's the main source of most of my anxiety. I think about mistakes I made 10 years ago and hits me like it happened yesterday. Trying to figure out how to let that shit go. 
Posting to Reddit is scary,"You'll be ok, have an upvote from me!"
"For every upvote, I will read one AOL Instant Messenger chat log from my high school days.","For each cringey thing you read, understand that it makes you cringe because you've learned something, and have grown as a person.

I suggest you use it to see how much you have grown. Imagine how much you'll have grown if you look back at your current self with cringe. :) Won't that future you be amazing? I think so!"
"Does anyone else get this sense of ""dread"" everytime you're home because you gotta go back to work the next day?",[deleted]
Some late night feelings being drawn by a sad child. I'm feeling better day by day. Hope everyone will feel the love <3,This is really good! Not been having the best day but this made it that little better. Thank you. 
Hey when was the last time you took a deep breath? Why don't you take one now?,"Sometimes I‚Äôm just driving along and I realize I‚Äôve been holding my breath! This is a great reminder, thank you :)"
This might be a silly thing for some people but I made a phone call!!!,"I sometimes feel like I‚Äôm the only one that struggles as bad as I do about phone calls. I definitely feel your pain there.

Good job!"
Having a long term anxiety disorder is being happy and confident for more than 2 days and then considering if it‚Äôs mania because it‚Äôs so unusual.,"It sounds like you have really sorted your life out. Well done, that's awesome. "
Does anyone else think up scenarios of how things will play out and get extremely worked up and anxious about it?,‚ÄúWe suffer more in imagination than in reality.‚Äù  is a great quote I‚Äôm trying to be more mindful of.
Can someone wish me a happy birthday?,Have a very happy birthday!
"Does hearing the sentence ""I have bad news"" make your anxiety shoot through the roof?",That or ‚ÄúI need to talk to you‚Äù via text while I‚Äôm at work. NOPE. I will obsess over it all day üò©
Me...always,Then you really get in trouble when you start overthinking about overthinking.
I had a party last night and didn't have any panick attack! I'm really proud of myself,proud of u too! :)
Anyone else take their headphones off their heads every 5 seconds to make sure they're not loud and someone else is hearing them?,Sometimes I'm scared I breathe too loud and I focus on it so much I cant not check
"It took me two trips to grocery stores and driving around for thirty minutes, but I finally got myself to go in and get food. I wish this wasn't something people would tell me to be proud of for trying and succeeding. This is my life",Part of getting better is accepting and doing stuff anyways.   Day by day.  Not accepting your present state will only make it worse in the long run.
I have anxiety and I'm terrified of confrontation so I create arguments in my head where I can say what I really feel. Does anyone else relate to this or am I just weird?,"It‚Äôs totally normal! I had a lot of issues with confrontation when I was a little younger and still do to some extent, and going back over how arguments could have gone was pretty common for me then. I still do now, as do a lot of people I think- even if you don‚Äôt avoid a confrontation it‚Äôs pretty common to remember things later you wish you‚Äôd remembered to say at the time that would‚Äôve made a killer argument.
Going over it in your head can be therapeutic to an extent, but thinking about explaining your position and actually doing it are as different as thinking about your favourite food and eating it; both are good feelings but only one will actually help you out. So my advice would be not to worry about it or be ashamed of it- what you‚Äôre doing is perfectly normal, but at the same time if you want to really put your views out there then don‚Äôt be satisfied with your current habits because they won‚Äôt get you where you want to be. Overcoming confrontation difficulties can be incredibly hard but even the tiniest steps can feel far more rewarding than any crutch strategies for dealing with these situations after the fact."
I GOT ACCEPTED TO COLLEGE!!,"Congrats! This is a oportunity to start from 0, to be who you wanna be in a new atmosphere. I've been there, and it was scary, but I was able to get new fantastic friends, learn a lot and have a lot less social anxiety. This is great, you deserved it!"
This girl at work today just knew i was in anxiety mode and gave me a hug and said let it wash away or something like that and it felt so good. Then I told her like yo that was really nice of you I was feeling a lot lately. And she gave me another hug and said I know how it is or something like that,It's amazing how powerful a hug can be sometimes.
4 months clean from self harm and substance abuse!,"Well done!! These are things I struggle with so I have the upmost respect for you, for getting this far. Keep it upüíñ"
Today im 96 days clean and sober,I'm a year and 4 months sober. I have tried many times but never made it this far. I got this far by realizing I was using drinking as a break from anxiety but all it did was cause depression and even more intense anxiety afterwards. It's not worth it
Shoutout to my brain for playing that embarrassing thing I said years ago that wasn‚Äôt that embarrassing and the other person definitely doesn‚Äôt remember on loop when I‚Äôm trying to sleep. Love that for me. üò¨,Shoutout to this shoutout for shouting out for all of us
Does anybody get anxiety because of too much empathy? I feel terrible for random people i see alone or for whatever random reason.,"Yeah, it's usually because I feel like I'm supposed to drop everything and do whatever I can to help. As if I'm the one responsible for fixing everyone's problems (even the ones that only exist in my head). It is stupid and exhausting."
You are going to be okay.,"""Being strong doesn't feel strong.""

I'll keep that for life."
Does anyone ever feel like they are extremely lonely but are also the one isolating yourself? (Ex: not going outside your house for days but also declining any offers to go out?),"You're not alone in the slightest. Barely left my dorm room this week. I'm incredibly lonely, but the thought of bringing myself to socialize with others or go outside is a nightmare. I know there's a party coming up that I'll be invited to, but I also know I'll end up staying home anyway. My living space is a mess and I've spent all my time either staring at the ceiling thinking about how terrified and alone I feel, or trying to keep myself distracted via youtube. You're 100% not alone. Weirdly comforting to know that I'm not either. I hope you find a way out of this vicious cycle."
"Do any of you ever wake up with that tough feeling around your chest, like weight, almost like guilt, and it even climbs up to your throat and whatever you do you just can't get rid of it? Feeling like you did something wrong, but you didn't.",EVERY. FUCKING. MORNING. 
"To me, Social Anxiety is walking to the other side of your office building, to use the bathroom nobody knows exists, just to avoid having to talk to your coworkers while washing your hands.",Same but my reason is to take a dump in peace knowing that nobody is going to walk in and judge me for pooping.
"I hate that even when I am being rational in my head and know I'm not *actually* upset about something, there's nothing I can do to not have the physical feeling of anxiety. My chest tightening, having a hard time breathing, the nausea.","I try to make my activity match my feeling, after the fact. 

So, if my heart is racing, I'll do something that will make my heart race. I'll go for a run. 

If my chest feels tight, I'll start doing pushups. 

If I get the funny feeling in my stomach, I'll do crunches or planks.

If my legs get a nervous, twitchy feeling, I'll do a wall sit.

I think once my brain and body are synchronized (my heart is beating fast BECAUSE I'm jogging) things get back to normal. Either that, or I've burned off ""nervous energy""

It's a bit more difficult to pull off in a crowded office, but it still works. (I'll just make an excuse that I'm ""stretching"" or ""my foot is asleep"" something.)"
Does anyone else unconsciously sigh constantly to calm themselves down and accidentally worry people/piss them off,"I do it literally all day at work l, the engineer behind me must want to choke me out by now. I 100% feel where your coming from tho because it gives me that 2 seconds of security. FYI if they allowed me to program at work with a giant comforter on I would totally do it lmao"
Anyone else get random cringe flashbacks?,"yep, constantly. the annoying thing is I'll often audibly cringe or call myself stupid or something out of nowhere. I probably look like I'm on drugs to innocent bystanders"
"After bombing at my working interview last week due to panic attacks, I got a second chance with an even better business in a similar role today. I decided to have fun with the interview and it was low-stress and anxiety. I GOT THE JOB.",Congratulations:)
"I am incredibly lonely all the time, but I feel so relieved when I don‚Äôt have to be around ppl. Anybody else experience something similar?","Yes. This is actually pretty common. 

If you‚Äôre like me, being around others can make you nervous, unless they‚Äôre very close to you. It takes a lot of energy to keep up acceptable social interaction.

If you‚Äôre comfortable talking about your anxiety, it can be surprisingly helpful to tell people you trust about this. It lessens the chance of hurt feelings, and it can be incredibly reassuring to have a friend look after your well-being. 

There are a few people these days that will ask where my energy is at before going out, and will offer to leave with me if I need to. That assurance alone is often enough to make me feel more relaxed.

You‚Äôre not broken. Your energy just has different parameters. Being social is draining.

It helps to practice. Eventually, you‚Äôll find a method hat works for you. Just don‚Äôt give up."
Telling somebody with anxiety to stop worrying is like telling somebody with epilepsy to stop having a seizure.,"I have heard this several times before and I just want to say this out loud for once rather than stifle it, let's call it an exercise in fighting my anxiety about how poorly it will be received.

I have epilepsy and anxiety.  I deal with both on a daily basis, they are both powerful beasts that can take similar forms but that are inherently distinctly different.  One key difference is this: anxiety is a cognitive function that can be harnessed and controlled; epilepsy is a biological process that, in most cases, cannot be halted through sheer willpower.  I view it like being trapped in a metal room - with anxiety, the door has heavy resistance and at times seems impossible to open; with epilepsy the same door is locked, barred and spot-welded shut.

Please don't get me wrong, anxiety can be crippling and is a severe widespread problem that should not be treated lightly.  My battles with both have been exhausting, but respectively very different.  These experiences have taught me one extremely important difference between the two:  anxious thoughts *must* must be faced to overcome anxiety, seizures do not have to be faced to overcome epilepsy.


To anyone out there with anxiety - you are not a victim, this sucks but you are not condemned to a life of these attacks/episodes.  You *can* pull yourself out of thought-spirals, overwhelming anxious thought, etc.  Maybe not this moment, maybe not next week or next year, but you can and with enough determination will do it.  Please don't compare yourself as someone who has a condition that can only really be managed with medication, it's not true and not fair to yourselves in your fight against anxiety.

Once again, it is not my intent to cause controversy, rather to vent a bit and clear some misconceptions.  I believe in you all and wish you peace and strength in your battles to come."
Anyone else just likes to retreat to bed when things go bad?,I love my bed. I pull the covers over my head and can daydream up entire worlds where I‚Äôm not scared all the time. Definitely my safe space.
"Does anyone else just want to sleep, cause you can't feel anxious if you're not conscious?",Yes
anxiety paradox; I don‚Äôt wanna die but I don‚Äôt wanna live like this,This is so real. You aren't alone in this battle.
"If you‚Äôre reading this, I hope you have an amazing day.",To you as well stranger! 
Does anyone else stay up all night because they're nervous about the next day?,"Yes. 
It's like my brain doesn't want the day to end and tries to trick himself by staying up."
"Today I made appointments for the dentist, eye dr, and physical therapist!!!! It was very draining and I had to get a little drunk to do it but I did it lol",Congrats!  Be mindful of how you may feel after each appointment.  Plan something nice for yourself afterwards.  Whatever makes you feel safe and calm.  I always feel like I need a nice warm hug after some doctor's appointments.
FUCK ANXIETY,"Yeah but we need to do something about it, what the hell are those research labs doing? For crying out loud it's the 21st century, we got airpods, VR technology, AI humanoid robots, 5G, flying drones and autonomous electric cars but anxiety/depression patients are still being given pills and told to ""just cope with it""? Like this ain't the 1950's or 1960's, can't they invent something more effective? We can't stay like this, man..."
I just want to tell someone that I'm trying.,"Same thing, man have too many physical problems with anxiety to name. My family is extremely annoyed with how long it‚Äôs lasted but I‚Äôm trying my best to fight. You‚Äôre not alone, this kind of stuff is a struggle all day everyday for me."
Anyone‚Äôs anxiety so bad that they sometimes question whether or not they actually have anxiety or if you‚Äôre making it up?,"Definitely! I call this ‚Äúanxiety about anxiety‚Äù.
When this happens I remind myself, whether it is anxiety or not, that all people have feelings. And feelings are temporary. All people need to treat those feelings whether they are anxious feelings or not. So just keep treating your feelings or anxieties or whatever comes your way dude."
"Anxiety means constantly trying to figure out whether that feeling in your gut telling you to ""ABORT MISSION!"" is real and important and should be listened to, or whether it's irrational catastrophizing that should be confronted and ignored.","I recently started a new job after being unemployed for more than a year due to anxiety and depression issues. It‚Äôs not what I want to be doing and am in a far lower position career wise than I was. It‚Äôs been two weeks and the anxiety is so strong that I feel like I‚Äôm going insane.
But I have to keep going no matter what. I have nothing left and need to provide for my family. I hope I survive. "
Finally passed my driver's test at 25!!!,YAY!
In case you need this today,Thank you. You're so lovely and considerate for thinking to post this!
I get anxious because I feel like no matter what I do I could be doing something better with my time so I end up doing nothing at all,"I hear you. I'll want to play a video game, or watch a show on Netflix, but then my brain goes down the rabbit hole of, ""Well I could be doing this, this, and this, which are way more productive."" This happens even if there are no chores left to do in the house. This thought process basically paralyzes me in my chair, and I end up scrolling through Reddit for hours instead of doing things I actually want to do. 

In the meantime my husband will be right next to me at his desk happily playing video games without a care in the world. I really envy him sometimes for being able to come home, sit down, and just *do whatever the fuck he wants.* It kills me when I accomplish absolutely nothing in a day. It leaves me with no goals, no enjoyement, and is just slowly killing me. This bizarre fear of wasting time just results in wasted time."
I just got fired on my first day and I don't know what to do,Why would they put you by yourself on your first day? Sounds like an awful manager. 
I got my driver‚Äôs license!!,hello i am going to take the drivers test in a few months but i always get anxiety while driving like chest tightness and sweaty palms and muscle tension do you have any advicd
Currently In a busy resturant eating by myself not giving a fuck,Damn!  That is one of my goals to accomplish by the end of this year! 
When you‚Äôre so used to feeling anxious that being calm and relaxed feels like a high,"Whenever I'm calm, I freak out and end up being anxious all over again. It never ends"
Does anyone else keep thinking about and over-analyzing humiliating events from 10+ years ago?,"Absolutely. Every single day, especially when I‚Äôm trying to sleep at night. Those thoughts just invade my head. It‚Äôs sooooooo tiring, I just want to switch that part of my brain off. "
"When you notice your mental health declining, do this:",Yesterday I decided to leave work early and invest the rest of the day to myself. If you have this option I highly suggest it. Quickly helped me regain mental energy
Anxiety is thinking everyone and no one cares about you at the same time,"So true. They judge you (they care about you negatively) but they don't support you (care about you positively).

Guess what. It's bullshit. The average random stranger on the street actually cares for you. Think about it. If you tripped and fell while walking on the street, wouldn't the person behind you reach down to help you up? If strangers care, certainly there are people in your life who do. Hell, I visit my pharmacy so often they know me by name (and birth date) and genuinely mean it when they ask how am I doing. "
[Humour] How We Were made,Isn't it weird how laughing about this stuff can actually make us feel better sometimes?
"Had anxiety for years and I finally plucked up enough courage to apply for a job and I got it, I am now building up money to move to London, fuck anxiety and depression will NOT take my life",Proud of you! That is a beautiful mindset ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
GOT THROUGH MY FIRST DAY OF WORK WITHOUT A PANIC ATTACK!,I'm so glad you had a good day !! Congratulations :) You deserve to feel proud
Ryan Reynolds Opens Up About His Lifelong Battle With Anxiety,Knowing that someone I look up to is dealing with the same thing I am has really put things into a new perspective
HEY EVERYONE I'M ANXIOUS AS FUCK BUT HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND ANYWAY OKAY?,STOP YELLING IT WILL HELP BUT THANK YOU
Anyone else stumble or mispronounce their words when they get anxious?,Stumble? When I'm really nervous the words don't even come out I just open my mouth and... Awkward. No coming back from that. That and less anxious times my voice rises and I sound like a mouse. And yes I mispronounce and even forget words. You're not alone 
Is there anyone else who feels like everyone finds them annoying?,Yes.  All the time
Does anyone else's stomach get messed up by anxiety?,[deleted]
"Do you ever feel like you have to tell someone how you feel, to get it out, but you also feel like you‚Äôre a burden to them, and then when you‚Äôve done it, you feel guilty?","Yes, I even feel like a burden when I shut up."
I think this adequately describes what I go through every single day.,I still enjoy doing things like these alone. Take heart- my wife was also like this to a degree before we met. Self sufficiency is a great quality to anyone looking for a good relationship. When you can both take care of yourselves you can also take care of each other. 
A painting about how anxiety feels,"As an artist myself, I have to say you are a really damn good artist. Holy cow."
It took me years to realize my anxiety was anxiety and not just my personality.,As I kid I thought I was just shy and that when I grew up it would go away and I'd be normal. Let's all laugh together. I'm happy you've figured stuff out about yourself and I wish you the best.
Overcoming Anxiety - Robert Ek,"So, among the modteam there was a bit of discussion about this since we don't allow memes, image macros or low-effort posts, while we simultaneously do allow artwork. This fell a bit in between the two, but we've decided to approve it for now.

On that note, among the modteam we are thinking of two things:

1. A weekly image thread, were you can post all the art, memes, comics etc.

2. Going text-post only, and only allowing posts similar to this, or article posts, to go with some text on why you liked it and wanted to share.

The two of them should allow people to enjoy those things while keeping the community mostly support-oriented, which is what we want since that's what support subreddits are all about.

Any thoughts shared by replying to this sticky comment is appreciated!"
"Is there anyone else here that makes themselves physically sick (such as vomiting, heartburn, etc) because of their anxiety?",Happens all the time. When I'm really anxious I get very bad heartburn and headaches. Pretty much everything starts to hurt and all I want is to stay in bed forever.
Doing a talk infront of 30 students tomorrow who are studying Mental Health and Community Services...got asked to give a talk about my own personal battles with anxiety and depression...little nervous...hope to do you all proud though üëç,"You got this, good luck üôèüèª"
Ugh. Posting comments on reddit gives me anxiety ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,"Same, I think that's just the way Reddit seems to go sometimes, try not to worry about it, it happens to absolutely everyone from time to time, no matter what you say üòä"
I introduced myself to my class today without my voice shaking. I call that a real victory. üòÑ,"That‚Äôs definitely a milestone, good for you! Use that victory to boost your confidence a bit :-) "
To anyone else who's having a self sabotage day,"I really needed this today, thank you. "
Anxiety,Pretty much sums it up.
Does anyone else feel like they're constantly doing something wrong but nobody's telling them what it is?,You're not alone. I regularly feel like I'm about to be fired or in trouble at work even though I've done nothing wrong and there's been absolutely no indication that they are unhappy with me. I try to use logic but it's exhausting.
"I hate when you drink caffeine to get energized, but instead just get a panic attack and consequently wiped out...",Green tea at a constant rate - less caffeine overall than coffee but without the ups and downs that cause the panic. At least that's what's worked for me.
Does anyone else get stomach pains and diarrhea with their anxiety?,"Any time I get even a twinge of anxiety it sets my stomach off and I get poop cramps and diarrhea.
It‚Äôs super annoying and inconvenient especially when out in public which lead me to have another phobia, shitting in someone‚Äôs car lmao."
Does anyone else feel like their anxiety swallows up their whole personality?,"I have definitely felt that way sometimes. I remember once my therapist asked me if I could envision who I would be without my anxiety, and it honestly scared me. I didn‚Äôt know how to answer, how to envision myself, who I would be. I have to remind myself that I am not my anxiety, it doesn‚Äôt control me, even if it really wants to, but that it is a real part of me, not just in my head, and that I have to accept it if I want to deal with it. "
I am too sensitive for this world,I‚Äôve said this multiple times throughout my life.
when your depression makes you push away your friends but your anxiety convinces you that they didn't care about you anyway...,Are you me?
I was just elected to City Council tonight.,"Congratulations on your victory. You championed your Anxiety for this fight. Also, congratulations on being elected. We got this together. Rome wasn't built in a day, neither were we. We'll do this the same way we always have, one day at a time!"
Does you anxiety ever make you feel like the people who love you the most actually think you're the worst person ever?,"It‚Äôs completely understandable to feel like this. Especially because you don‚Äôt like or love yourself so you begin to doubt the ones who do. 

The biggest thing to remember is that they‚Äôve been with you this long, through all your ups and downs so of course they love you!!"
I graduated college today,I can't achieve my goals but congratsüèÜüèÜüèÜ happy for yaüòä
Anxiety is having to leave for work at a certain time even though you know you‚Äôre still going to be 30 minutes early,"Anyone else get ready 20 minutes before you actually need to leave, then just sit around being anxious for 20 minutes?"
Being around people all day is just exhausting.,"Absolutely! I‚Äôm an outgoing introvert ‚Äî when in groups, I‚Äôm charismatic, funny, and social, but after a few hours, I can physically feel my ‚ÄúSocialization Health Bar‚Äù decreasing. I talk less and become more of a listener. Then I need to go home and be alone to recharge that ‚ÄúSocialization Health Bar‚Äù for the next day."
Currently at the movies alone for the first time in my life. I‚Äôm kind of freaking out with my hands shaking but I‚Äôm also a bit proud I‚Äôm doing it - going to the movies alone has been something I‚Äôd always wanted to do but been too anxious and self-conscious to do,"Just so you know, literally no one there cares that you‚Äôre there alone. And if anyone notices, nothing bad will happen to you. It‚Äôs all good."
anyone else find they need near constant background noise to help stop anxious/depressed inner thoughts?,Yup. It's why I fall asleep to TV and am always listening to something
Hey,We will see better days. Happy New Year! ü§ó
"Things that helped me manage my anxiety, maybe this can help you too","Great read. It's a battle but know that you are not alone. Going to try a few of your tips.

"I‚Äôm finally leaving this sub, best of luck to all of you, wish I could hug every single one of you.","I'm recovered thank God because of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. But I'm sticking around to help others suffering, paying it back and forward."
I‚Äôm so proud of myself. I just started college. I‚Äôm a week in. I haven‚Äôt had friends to talk to in person in years. I made 4 wonderful friends and they made me so happy last night.,That's awesome! I move in 3 days from now for my freshman year. Hope everything goes well for the both of us
The Mayor of my town posted this on Facebook this morning...great message!,"This hit me hard, it's like what everyone who was in my life have just blown it off and let me suffer including my parents, closest friends, and boyfriends. I wouldn't wish a panic disorder on anyone, but for one day, if it made everyone understand, I might. I'd love to switch for a day and see what ""normal"" was"
Anxiety is trying to stop me from going to a car wash so I‚Äôm going to the car wash in an act of sheer disrespect towards anxiety,"You‚Äôre brave for getting out. 


Anxiety is a shit roommate, so please be shitty to it in return."
Hey if you're reading this and your in a bad spot mentally or anything I hope you feel better soon and have a good day.,Thank you
Can I just say...,But... I always lose.
"When someone tells me ""it's all in your head""",If you could think your way out of an anxiety disorder it wouldn't be a disorder.
Anyone else get panic attacks when they‚Äôre family starts yelling/arguing?,Big reason why I developed bad anxiety and started having panic attacks. What I did was to lock myself in my room and pretend I didn't exist. What I should have done is get out of the house and go for a walk or anything but stay inside hearing all the yelling.
I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this but EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT!,How? Elaborate
"Hi everyone! Long ago i heard (or read) someone say something about anxiety that help me a lot and i'd hope it could work for you too: ""Anxious people are some of the most courageous people on earth because they face their fear everyday""",I like this. Makes me feel better :)

We're going out to get coffee soon üòäüòä","you made a big step by asking him. you took a shot at it, which is what counts. If he's currently with someone just keep in touch and look for someone else, don't focus on him. There's plenty of people out there :)"
Are you ok? Leave your user name and I'll check in on you at least once this month and ask you how are you going.,This is the kindest thing I‚Äôve seen on here in a while. This world is lucky to have people like you. Thank you :) 
"Does anyone ever feel so bad for saying no to someone that you end up saying yes, and then end up in a situation that you can‚Äôt get out of but should have never been part of...?"," I hear ya, especially if it's family. Often they'll ask for help, and I'll auto answer with something like, ""Sure, in a bit"", which ends up being hours later or not at all. Then I have to fight the anxiety of having to face them. 

Dunno about your situation, but for me I think I may be trying to please (the person requesting) and also neglecting my own needs. May not help me that typically if I do declined then there's a slew of questions which I also rather avoid. :(

Hope this was a bit helpful, cheers"
"If you see this, you better have a good fucking day!",Thank you friend. Needed to read this today.
Worth remembering if you're having a bad day.,"This needs to be posted at the front of my diary, in my cubicle, on my phone, hell, tattooed in the palm of my hand for quick, sweaty reference. Thank you."
This is how you can stop cringing at that embarrassing thing you did 5 years ago!,I have a few memories of other people's embarrassing moments.

Have you guys been crippled by your anxiety so much that you just don't do your assignments?,"I have this kind of problem. When i get anxious about anything , my head just tells me to not do it and my body stops moving as if im in chains. Even when i feel like dying or having a depressive episode because of it. I literally have to force myself before i can go and drink prescription meds because my head says i shouldnt do so.. its insane. Its like i want to suffer. My parents asked me why im choosing to be this way , and idk how is it choosing to be this way when i cant control myself?  If anyone knows how to get past thru this please do tell ."
Who else has anxiety about not doing enough with their life?,"It's really a shame that the current system makes us feel that way. I'm pretty sure most people feel like that. The thing is, you need to know what you personally value and then act according to those values. Do you value success more than holistic living? Do you value money more than happiness? Do you value work more than creativity? You should prioritize your values according to your preference. Then you won't be so doubtful about the path you chose for yourself.

There's also this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCO8eoDWqHQ) by Hank Green that I always love to share talking about jobs and careers and life."

Anyone else have to basically be dead to call off of work and not feel guilty?,"My husband is like this. I think the only reason why he can actually ask off now is because I encourage him about it. I know how hard it is for him to do so, but when he needs to, I am very supportive and it makes it easier for him. 

However, you can coach yourself instead of needing someone else to. Try to look at it objectively or as if it's someone else. Your partner, friend, parent-- they are sick and ask you if they should take off work? What do you say to them? 

You could even do a pros/cons list. Though certain items on the list should weigh heavier: your physical and mental well-being."
"I just found out about this subreddit and spent the last hour scrolling throught it. Never felt so good in a long time, you guys bring me hope and it is freaking awesome, so many positive vibes and helpfull tips. This is one of the best remedy i ever had.....",Dude same!

"Thank you to my car for giving me a place to scream, cry, and have panic attacks in peace.",I feel this... the amount of times I have pulled over by the side of the road and had a mental breakdown lol.

Does anyone else obsess over every little thing they say to people?,"I‚Äôm 27. Sometimes I get anxiety about things I said to people in 6th grade.

Edit: so I‚Äôm reading a lot of comments saying they suffer the same thing. Obsessive thinking like this is a common symptom of other things that aren‚Äôt anxiety. Like bipolar disorder and OCD. This is a reminder to make sure you are properly diagnosed. 

I was misdiagnosed for years until I was properly put on the right medication and these thoughts went away. Talk to your doctor because obsessing over thoughts from years ago isn‚Äôt a common thing in anxiety disorder. Please talk to your doctor."

Does anyone else still stress out and feel embarrassed over things that happened 10-20 years ago?,"Yes.

I read elsewhere on reddit that if you cringe at a memory, it means you learned something. Most of the stuff you cringe at, no one else would likely remember.

I feel some pity for the person I was, remember what I learned, maybe if I did better subsequent circumstances, and try to just move on to completely different memories."

Anyone get anxious and paranoid when they're feeling great? ie 'oh fuck when is this going to end and why',Yes alllll the time.

How my agoraphobia makes me feel when I have to leave my house,"Link to the artist's instagram: [johnkennmortensen] (https://www.instagram.com/p/BTjRgQsDXiV/)

I have panic disorder with agoraphobia and I've had to leave the house a good bit lately because of health problems. I saw this gif this morning and it instantly reminded me of how I feel shuffling into yet another doctors office, hospital, clinic, etc, with a constant sense of impending doom hanging over my head that no one else sees, leaving me feeling like a hopeless shell of a person. "
I skipped work today due to my anxiety and now I'm so disappointed with myself. Anyone else ever done the same thing?,"You know, sometimes it‚Äôs necessary to take care of our selves. Having anxiety is no different from calling in with the flu. Don‚Äôt feel bad. Take care of yourself. Best wishes."
"Hey, Can I have a moment of your time?","I needed this, been overthinking small ass mistakes and can‚Äôt stop worrying a lot. Thank you!"

Does anyone get the feeling that you're supposed to be worrying about something but you just can't figure out what it is?,"I feel that way all the time. That voice in my head is searching for something to worry about, almost as though if I don't worry about something, bad things will happen. Like I NEED to be worrying about something. I think it may be habits of thought that we have formed. One thing that helps me is reminding myself that sometimes that voice in my head is just anxiety, not me, and I'm that which hears that voice. I hope things improve for you."

Definitely an unruptured brain aneurysm that is soon to burst. 
Small tattoo but big step,"I love the semi colon movement , and it's awesome that you got that tattoo and are trying to have a positive outlook ‚ù§Ô∏è i don't know you at all but I'm proud "
Fuck anxiety,"I wish I could, but it fucks me instead"
Anxiety is just your brain coming up with fake news,"Ha ha, yeah. This https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/7mhv6a/anxiety_is_like_when_video_game_combat_music_is/ really explains my feelings. Stupid brain making me think there are threats when there aren't any.

Fake news!"
I drew my anxiety,Captures the essence. How would you draw yourself without anxiety?
I (F17) told my dad about my anxiety and got unexpected reaction,Wow.  You made my eyes fog up.  Very happy for you.
anyone gets stomach upset when anxious ?,"This, 100%.   I get super nauseous with my anxiety peaks.  Which really sucks for things like going out to dinner or anything to do with food.  Then the nausea leads to more anxiety about throwing up, its a vicious cycle."
I got my drivers license.. at 29,Age doesn‚Äôt matter friend . We go through life at our own phases . Congrats on getting your license ! Have fun and be safe friend !
The list I keep on my phone to help me calm down during high stress and anxiety,It takes a special person to take this much effort to help others. Thank you
We don't deserve this.,Needed this today. Every day is an accomplishment! We did it! 
Do you ever stay up late even when you‚Äôre exhausted to avoid facing the next day? Venting,"Yeah, I'm guilty of doing this a lot for a variety of things. Most recently would probably be over a job I had that wasn't working out. I hated it and started to dread each day so much that I would just stay up as long as I could just to avoid having to wake up and get ready. It made me feel like I was delaying it at least by a little bit."
Has anyone else been anxious since they were a kid?,"I‚Äôve been anxious since puberty. Middle school, around the time I got my period I started becoming really quite and started obsessing over things. High school it turned into anxiety about grades and responsibilities, and now in college it‚Äôs everything but I‚Äôm on meds and seeing a therapist so I guess that‚Äôs good lol. I also notice it gets really bad around my time of the month. Still trying to convince my doctors of it..."
I love you,thank you!
i went to a bookstore and got a coffee by myself today!,"Hey that is awesome!! I know how hard that can be, I have a real problem going to public places alone as well. I'm so proud that you pushed yourself to do this & hope you can always remember how good it felt."
"Today was my first good day in months. My anxiety and depression have stayed low, and I have a positive number in my bank. I feel like I've done some hard work just to have one good day, but it's encouraging.","That's awesome to hear. It's inspiring hearing stuff like this. I just joined the subreddit not even a minute ago. I had such bad anxiety (worst I've ever had multiplied by ten fold) about a week and a half ago, which caused me to feel like I was having a 3 day heart attack. Finally that symptom has subsided, and up until tonight, it's been so much better.

There is hope!"
"My son isn't even two yet, but sat beside me through an anxiety attack.","My daughter's done the same for me! She's just turned two. She goes ""don't cry, mummy"" and brings me a tissue and then sits next to me and holds my hand till it's over. She's the best. "
"Do you ever have a week or two without symptoms and then start to think maybe you're finally getting better, but then you're hit with a day which is worse than you'd remembered?","with you on this.  its extremely aggravating and defeating.  
hope you get back on the ups soon."
I WENT TO A CONCERT BY MYSELF!!,yay :) who‚Äôd you go see?
Does anybody get upset if they are going to be late?,Yup....this is a huge trigger for me. I hate being late. I think it is because growing up my family was always late to stuff. 
Does anyone else get anxiety around people there own age but are fine with older people?,"Yes! I am the same way. I think it‚Äôs because I feel more pressure to fit in with people my age, so I feel like I gotta change who I am to fit in with them. But with older people, I feel like I can just be who I am. Idk how to change that tho lol"
UPDATE: OH MY GOD YOU GUYS I GOT MY FIRST JOB!!,"Congrats!!! This is a huge step. 

It's not JUST bagging groceries. You're helping to keep a business running, helping them MAKE MONEY. You=value added. 

Good job !!!"
"When I'm anxious, I procrastinate. After I procrastinate, I ruminate. Since I'm ruminating, I'm anxious to even get anything done, that I should have long started, thinking, ""What's the point of doing it now, remember the first time you tried and failed by procrastinating ...""","And anxiety is checking and rechecking number of upvotes or comments, to wonder if I'm the only one who feels like this."
"Here's to all of us at work who have snapped at colleagues, cried quietly at desks (or bathroom), had panic attacks and ruminated about it for hours on end!",[deleted]

"""A man who fears suffering is already suffering from what he fears""",Very good ! Where is this from ?
"I don't give a shit about ""leaving my comfort zone"", I just want to feel comfortable right now","I hear you, man. I'm not someone who's stuck in their house or anything but I've thrown myself so far out of my comfort zone that I'm struggling to get the days to go by. I wonder what was wrong with staying in my comfort zone and continuing to do what I was doing. I was in a very happy place and now I've got needless stressors. I really didn't need the life skill of how to go to work while your heart is beating a death dirge and you're dry heaving because you hate your job so much. But here we are. Wondering how to go back to the fun side."
"Hey you. Yes, you.",Thank you- needed that
Was suicidal with anxiety eight years ago...getting married on Saturday.,congratulations!!!
Tonight I finally asked the guy in the next apartment over to stop yelling to people over the computer to all hours of the night after about 3 months of trouble sleeping because of the noise.,"I am so proud of you!!!  That's huge (and something that I am not sure I would have been able to accomplish!) 

Well done! And fingers crossed for a good nights sleep :)"
Getting out of bed is really hard for me. Is anyone else's anxiety worst in the morning?,"Absolutely, I‚Äôm feeling this way right now and it‚Äôs really disheartening especially after a good day beforehand. I know that once I get up and shower I‚Äôll feel better but I have no motivation to do so. I‚Äôm looking for answers too"

"A cute comic today. It came with the tagline: '""oh, don‚Äôt cry"" ‚Äì proven to stop all crying, 100% of the time'","Nothing makes me more angry than someone telling me to calm down. OH OK THANKS I DIDNT THINK OF THAT BEFORE DICK FACE. 

Edit: telling me not to worry will elicit the same response. Before I started getting help for my anxiety, all I did was worry. That's like telling someone not to breathe. "
Painted how disassociation feels to me,This is incredible.
"You can do WAY more than you think, don't let your insecurities define you. Listen to the wisdom inside you and cherish it. You have something good to bring into this world, let it be heard. Have a nice day ;)",Thanks for this post! I needed this this morning!
Does everyone else's anxiety feel more intense at night?,"Same here. I feel like it's just being alone with your thoughts, or feeling more alone that does it for me. Also just having a strange feeling of stillness in the world around you, especially at night, is very unmotivating to me. "
Summers when you have anxiety,With my anxiety I'm legit happy if nothings happening. last pic is happyasf.jpg
Today I joked at the office,"first post make me smile, I am happy for you"
"Have you ever felt anxious because everything in your life is going on perfectly, but you are worried about something wrong that might be happening without you realize it?","Absolutely, yes. I suspect it's because my brain is scanning for threats (evolution) and finding none feels . . . foreign / incorrect / unlikely. And also, anxiety, for me, has worn a rut in my brain and become a habit of mind. Calm feels uncomfortable & I want to control it, but can't."
I ordered two Subway sandwiches successfully!,"Congrats! Subway is the worst, I can‚Äôt even count the number of times I repeat my order to myself in the 3 minute drive to subway"
Having anxiety is exhausting.,I wonder the same thing sometimes too... My anxiety has worsened this past year after a very traumatic experience and I‚Äôm constantly worrying about things all day. I can‚Äôt think about anything without doubting myself... it‚Äôs incredibly exhausting
Fuck Anxiety. I Am Legend.,"u/kingkamyar I'm with you, brother. Like you said, this fucking thing is brutal but as long as we get up every day we're still in the game. 

People who don't have anxiety can't really understand how hard it is;enduring this battle in your head every single day .Anxiety will make you feel like shit then tell you you're a peice of shit for thinking and feeling the way you do - the left right combo haha.It's so important to acknowledge your achievements - make no mistake,  these are huge ! Keep going!"
Anyone else get anxiety about having anxiety,"Yepp. Sometimes I even wake up fine and think, where's the anxiety at? This is weird. Oh wait there it is. I sabotage myself."
The thing about an anxiety disorder is that,"Yes, I find it difficult just to get out of bed because of this and of course unless a person has anxiety, they wont understand. Which makes it even more frustrating."
"Who else is in their mid-late 20's and has hardly experienced life and never ""go out""?","Right here, 23, never traveled outside the UK, never felt love, never loved anyone and making no progress towards my goals.

I literally just stay in my room all day, to be fair I kind of want to be left alone as I don't really like people, everyone I've meet have ridiculed me, mocked me, sometimes I think about them and gone over scenarios in my head where I hurt them (though I'm making progress towards stopping that. Don't really care about ""going out"" as I hate drunk people, stupid people, being drunk and crowded places.

I've gotten into photography, writing, weight training and boxing as well as continuing my long-term passion of watching movies, I'd love to make them but there's no way I'll ever be doing that."
"I was having a particularly rough morning dealing with my anxiety yesterday morning. I decided to call in sick, but the idea of having to call in sick made me anxious and as a result, ended up going to work...",Taking a mental health day is harder than people think!
"Anyone else lost the energy to deal with people, like ANY people, even friends?",I feel like this a lot of the time. My social battery is very short and I easily get overwhelmed by conversations
"This made me smile, maybe it'll make you smile, too.","I'll quote Alan Watts ""The prevalent sensation of oneself as a separate ego enclosed in a bag of skin is a hallucination""

Who else gets stomach issues and thinks it's related to being anxious often?,Anyone else lose their appetite during anxious spells... 
"Guys, is anyone here having stomach problems because of anxiety ?",IBS and othe gastrointestinal issues are super comorbid with anxiety.  I get a different thing every day.
I booked my first therapy appointment!,Hooray!! Therapy has changed my life. I am very happy for you! üôåüèæüéâ
Anyone else get paranoid that everyone hates them?,"All. The. Time. In fact, thinking absolutely everyone hates me is that only way I can rationalise that they actually don‚Äôt. Thoughts aren‚Äôt reality. EVERYONE can‚Äôt hate me surely? Meditation also helps."
I drowned my baby sister in my mom's birthday,[deleted]
After fighting years of having a crippling fear of heights I climbed MT. Fuji today! [image],"This isn't defeating anxiety, this is dunking on it and selling it on a poster. Awesome!"
I wonder what non-anxious people think about all day.,Same. I feel like I‚Äôve been robbed of so many quality thoughts and feelings.
Does anyone else find it a little surreal that people just go about their lives?,"I feel the same way. Its hard not to beat myself up about it either. Here I am struggling my way through college, trying to do all the right things this semester but still ending up taking a 2nd medical leave so I'm graduating 2 years later than everyone else I know. Can't help but think I've let myself down and ""why can't I just be like everyone else"" even though I tried as much as I could."
Calmed myself down from a severe panic attack. I'm proud of myself.,"Way to go, I am glad to hear you calmed yourself down. Remember that next time and breathe always breathe."
"I‚Äôm 22, living at home, haven‚Äôt had a job in months and am now just applying for a construction company. Wish me luck I‚Äôm sick of feeling like a failure.",Best of luck. Remember that you are not a failure and  there is no rush to be anywhere in life. 
Does anyone else cry when someone is unhappy with you or after being scolded?,I cry anytime someone wants to have a serious conversation.
What it's like to have high functioning anxiety,"Oh fuck this is me. I thought the not answering text messages was just something that happened... I never thought it had anything to do with anxiety.

I mean, I knew *I* had trouble replying. I didn't realize this was a common symptom. "
I hope something nice happens to you today.,Right back at ya
Anyone else really enjoy eating lunch alone?,i enjoy doing a lot of things alone while simultaneously being terrified of being alone. ha. =/
"Overcoming self-defeating behaviors is not easy; it‚Äôs a journey that may take years. Remember that you did not develop this self-defeating behavior overnight. Which probably means that you will not be rid of them overnight either, so the key to success is patience, resilience, and passion","Thank you for this reminder. My anxiety tosses a blanket of impatience over my self-improvement. Then I beat myself up for not being better. Sometimes I remind myself of Anya from Buffy saying ""I *was* being patient but it took too long"" and it makes me smile, and in that moment I feel some relief. I think TV series can help contribute to my resilience in a way. Hope you are feeling well today Practicallongevity"
Today I won.,"yay!!  i just brushed my teeth, but i need to take a shower."
Have you ever postponed crying and then couldn't cry later?,"Yep, it sure does. I have been sad at times and just can't cry and it makes me feel sick tbh"
I'm anxious about being able to get a job so I avoid applying to jobs so I don't feel anxious about it so I feel more anxious about not having a job!,"I was just in this slump. Try going to the library or a cafe with your laptop and applying outside. It helped me a lot to have a fresh ""space"" and made me feel forced"
today i broke out of my anxiety and went to the cinema alone,"Well done! I did this about 3 years ago and now I choose to go to the cinema alone as a form of self-medication. If I am having a hard time, instead of going home after work I head to the cinema and watch something. I treat myself to some popcorn and a huge drink, get absorbed in a movie and enjoy the feeling of escapism. It shakes my routine up (which helps get me out of funks) and gives me a sense of accomplishment."
Does anyone else get anxiety from being seen by someone they know?,Yeah I did. I had to move to new city to get over it.

Happy Fourth of July to all of the anxiety sufferers out there who are stuck at home or having to make excuses to others as to why they can‚Äôt be somewhere. The isolation is real.,Today is my birthday. I'm at home on reddit. Welcome friends.
Self-checkout line is the best thing to have happened to humanity,"> Your girl just wants to go to the grocery store at 11 PM

Except the Walmart near me. They close all the self checkouts down at like 9 and have a single register open after. It's fucking maddening. Hopefully with the renovation and the fuck-ton of self checkouts they have added this will change but I don't see it happening."
Finally decided to woman up and visit a psychiatrist today and got told that I had severe anxiety and panic disorder and should've visited sooner. Hopefully will get my life back on track. My mind has exhausted me.,The worst part about having a mental illness is family saying mean comments like that. Goodluck
Does anyone else feel like their friends and family secretly hate them and so you are terrified to talk to them and make things worse but you‚Äôre probably just being paranoid?,"Yep! It's crippling, cause I don't think they really want me around. üòû"
I‚Äôm very grateful for my cat,You‚Äôre very lucky that your cat can sense when  you need it the most. Cats are amazing creatures. 
Anyone else get irrationally anxious to the point where they just clear notifications instead of reading them?,"I have that all the time. I find that if I just pick it up and respond right away it's not as stressful/difficult/scary as I thought to reply or take care of whatever it is. I leave my phone alone for hours at a time because it stresses me out to figure out what to say or do, especially when I know the notification is about something I already stress about, but it's worse the longer I leave an unread text or email on my phone so I've learned to just take care of it instantly. It takes a minute then it's over! I hope this makes sense and is helpful.

I agree with the previous poster that you should turn off your phone an hour or two before bed and not look at it again. I sleep so much better this way!"
Does anyone‚Äôs anxiety manifest as irritability or negative thoughts towards yourself?,"Yup, this is one of my biggest signs I'm spiraling, I'm \*constantly\* comparing myself to everyone else and telling myself I suck/I'm too fat/I'm too whatever else my brain is fixating on.

&#x200B;

If only someone would invent an off switch for brains!"
I took a shower today!,TFW you dont have the motivation to shower but when you eventually do it's so relaxing you don't wanna get back out üòå
Anyone just feel cloudy minded from anxiety? Like you can‚Äôt think straight but you can still function?,"I almost always have a brain fog. I would describe it as white noise. It seems like my brain is busy thinking about a lot of things, but I‚Äôm not connected to what it‚Äôs thinking about, so if someone asks me what I‚Äôm thinking about I truly have no idea. I can still function pretty well in day to day life, but it makes socializing very difficult.  It also sometimes feels like my brain is operating at about 5%; like a computer that tries to boot up but the operating system requires more resources then the computer can handle, so it just gets stuck on the loading screen. Which also often makes me feel tired, like I never fully wake up. 

 Very Occasionally I have good days where my head seems clear and i almost feel talkative - I‚Äôm generally a very quiet person and people often assume I‚Äôm shy, but my brain just can‚Äôt figure out what to say. But on those good days I feel like a totally different person.   I don‚Äôt know if this is similar to what you‚Äôre describing, but it sucks and wish I could find a way to have more good days."
Hey You! üß°,"Thank you, that‚Äôs pretty awesome of you!

Hope you‚Äôre doing well üòÅ"
Guys‚Äîfor the first time in my life I stopped a panic attack before it started.,"Congratulations!

In case it's ever helpful here's a trick my therapist taught me: breath in to a count of 4, hold for 7, then slowly release for 8.

(Breath in 1 one thousand, two one thousand...hold for 7, out really slowly over 8)

In the event that tuning into your surroundings doesn't help in the future give this a shot, I've found it super useful for ""pausing"" the feeling of an inevitable panic attack. Also great to practice ahead of time till it gets boring and routine."
Words cannot describe how proud of myself I am right now.,"You should be proud of yourself! That‚Äôs a huge achievement, well done! "
Sorry... I couldn't help myself. I haven't felt this happy since I was a kid.,[deleted]
I haven't self harmed in one whole year.,"I'm happy for you as well, Merry Christmas"
Happy World Mental Health day everyone!,"Funny, it's mental health day and my anxiety is the worse it's been in years"
Feeling lonely when no one is around you is bad enough. Feeling lonely even when people are around you is torture.,Completely relate. The feeling isn‚Äôt your true self though. It‚Äôs not your fault your mind is programmed to react in these ways. Just take some time and make yourself feel happy with yourself and then return to others when you feel better :). You are loved. 
DAE get messages from others that you are too anxious to read and then get anxious all over again the longer you don't reply?,[deleted]
First anxiety attack in front of boyfriend,"this is the type of wholesome content I needed today. 

Hold that boy close and never let him go."
"Does anybody else often click the ""discard post"" button because they're worried about people being judgemental?","I do all the time, posts on reddit, group chats, everything,

It can help sometimes if you were going to say something you would regret later, but it can hurt if you don‚Äôt say something you wish you had said.

It‚Äôs all about finding the balance"
Anxiety is like an app is sending you constant push notifications and you can't disable them.,"My favorite is ""Anxiety is like that moment when you close the door and realize you might have accidentally left the keys inside. But unending."""
Anyone else get anxiety over just making a Reddit post?,Yes. People can be awesome but also so mean on Reddit. It seems like they have no concept that there is a person who posted something out of goodwill or interest. I am sorry that has happened to you. It has happened to me too.
Does anyone here also worry they are cringey/annoying all the time?,"When he broke up with me, my ex outright said that my interests and the way I spoke were cringey so now it's become a constant worry of mine, I feel you"
Who has social anxiety or panic disorder but seems completely normal on the outside?,"you are definitely not alone. i can sit through an entire conversation on the verge of passing out & the person i am conversing with would never know. At this point, I have gotten to where I can let the anxiety pass through after a few minutes and it‚Äôll leave but it is still a struggle every now and then. however, there have been times where i will start profusely sweating and the person i‚Äôm talking to asks if i‚Äôm ok and that when i‚Äôve had to retreat to a restroom or somewhere outside to calm myself down. definitely a real struggle and anyone i tell i have an anxiety disorder to is always so surprised because it‚Äôs usually hard to tell from the outside."
Hey YOU,"wow I needed to read something like this very much, thank you üñ§"
"I can‚Äôt even remember how it felt like not suffering from anxiety fuelled depression, I‚Äôm 35 and having the worst time of my life. Today, I forced myself to go to the gym despite my inner voice saying I can‚Äôt. Feeling great about it.",Go you! That voice that tells you you can‚Äôt is so powerful and you kicked its ass today.
Today is my cake day AND my actual birthday.,Happy birthday cake day!
I brushed my teeth!,"That's a great habit to get into. Keep it up, I'm rooting for you!"
"Does anyone else have that dilemma of wanting to see a therapist for your anxiety, but your anxiety keeps you from making an appointment? üôÉüôÉ","And the initial appointment or going somewhere new is the worst for my anxiety. Like I want to see a therapist for the first time, but I get super anxious about finding somewhere "
"When the day is over, let it go. Don't dwell on what you could've or should've done. Tomorrow is another day and another chance. If it's meant to be, it will come again.","really needed this, thank you for sharing! recently i've been trying to just live one day at a time because that's all i can manage. if i make it through the day unscathed, that's great. if it's been a bad day, a new one will begin soon."
I just ordered food by myself!,You guys are so nice :‚Äô)
The constant fear that all my friends hate me and think I‚Äôm annoying and want me to stop talking but are too nice to say anything is crushing,"I was scared too. A few days ago I realized that some of my friends don't give a shit about me. So I don't call them ""friends"" anymore and I haven't messaged them since then. Now, I feel like I have only one friend and I'm okay with that, I trust her."
"An accurate portrayal of when you're casually hanging out with friends and, simply out of the blue, anxiety hits.","Okay so you have one thing you have to do in this moment:  FOCUS ON OTHER PEOPLE.  Listen to what they are saying, be IN THE MOMENT, and get out of YOUR HEAD.  Imagine that the only thing that matters is CARING about what they are saying, not just listening, but actually CARING.  CARE WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT.

This actually does help.

Alternatively when you can't get out of your head and your anxious worries won't shut up, find someone to listen and care about.  CARE about them and LISTEN to them and you will feel so differently.  Our anxiety is selfish and wants all of our attention and by caring about others you teach it not to invade your life 24/7."
Anxiety robbed me of my personality,I've let it consume my life far too much.
Goat which suffers from anxiety only calms down when she is put in her duck costume,For some reason even the title of the article gave me a little chuckle. I figured I would share in hopes it lightens the load on your shoulders at least a touch. 
"do any of you ever have really bad anxiety episodes that make you wonder ""how the fuck am i going to make it through the rest of my life like this?""","That's how I've been feeling the last few days. I know this will pass but goddamn I am a jittery, vibrating mess."
What having a mental illness feels like. :(,Oh yeah. It's hard to deal with me sometimes. I know because I have to deal with me. 
Do you ever feel calm and become anxious because you don't understand why you're so calm?,Yep! I always feel as if there‚Äôs something I should be doing and I get anxious because I can‚Äôt recall what exactly it is.
Does anyone get anxiety from feeling like you're wasting your time?,All the time. Even when productive I don‚Äôt feel enough is coming out of my hands.
"Foodies who no longer have the energy - I'm writing a cookbook to help people who no longer have the motivation to cook through depression or other issues and instead resort mainly to things like fast food, may I ask what you like to see in it?","This is great! Just to put in my two cents, I think you should have some dishes that don‚Äôt require much clean up (ex: One pan or pot). For me I can often motivate myself to make a good dinner once a week but then just stop making anything for a few days. I find that I neglect cleaning my kitchen when the dish load is overwhelming and the thought of adding to it or having to clean everything before I can cook is a deterrent."
does anyone else sometimes feel PHYSICALLY sick from anxiety?,"It can cause physical sickness,  yea I can get so nauseous and can't eat many times. Chest pain and tightness.  Sometimes just due to thoughts. Even diarrhea really..  it sucks. Hope you the best. "
"It's really hard to ""be strong and carry on"" when all I want to do is curl up in bed and go to sleep.","You just said everything I‚Äôm feeling right now. I made it to work this  morning but the ‚Äúsomethings wrong‚Äù feeling just got worse and worse, and then i didn‚Äôt know how to tell my supervisor i needed to leave because I‚Äôd had a smile plastered to my face all morning. 

I hope we both feel better soon."
DAE's anxienty always make you assume that poeople are mad at you?,"Every single day. Anything less than overt kindness (or in the case of texting, smile emojis and exclamation marks) makes me assume I've done something to make a person mad and that they now hate me. 

It kills me, especially at my job. Every day I'm worrying that my boss absolutely hates me or that I'm about to get fired."

I hope she can find her peace in her mind. I really appreciate this post, suicide prevention is not talked about enough imo"
A cool anxiety technique I learned,"This seems like a good technique to try! I get so overwhelmed sometimes I have to try things like this. My old therapist taught me a similar technique called grounding: when I start to get overwhelmed and begin to dissociate I can try naming things I can actively see, smell, touch, etc. Your method is another that might help. "
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck,Talk it out buddy. We're here for you
Does anyone else hate how easily other people can ruin your day?,"I feel ya. I also work with kiddos who have anxiety. It is somewhat relieving to know that I'm not the only one whose entire day can be thrown off by a comment that everyone else seems like they can brush off, but for me it becomes this huuuuge thing in my head that I can't get over. I find myself cringing about past interactions with people I consider to be friends MONTHS after that perceived awkward interaction. Some days are better than others, and some days are blissful. I try and repeat a positive mantra when those thoughts surface and remind myself that this is something I'm just learning to identify and work through, just like my students."
DAE purposely stay up late so that they are so exhausted when they try to sleep instead of tossing & turning due to anxiety?,"it's only 1am so far, so it's gonna be a while for me. but yes."
"Huge victory, today I faced one of my biggest fears and got a panic attack in return. Took a train and it got stuck between two stations due to a technical problem. I considered pressing the emergency button and prying open the train door. Instead, I embraced the panic attack and pulled through.",I'm proud that you got on the train and pulled through the attack!
Ever have days where your anxiety is incredibly high for absolutely no reason?,"I woke up and knew immediately I needed to be underneath the covers, unfortunately I can't call out unless deathly ill."

bro im straight up not having a good time,"Man we don‚Äôt know each other but here‚Äôs a cringe story,

At a family/friend party and there was a girl there I liked/ was friends with. Keep in mind she‚Äôs there with her boyfriend. 
I had way to much to drink and all I can remember is me giving him the finger and threatening to fight him while we were playing beer pong.  
Really embarrassing cause there‚Äôs aunts and uncles and parents and friends there.
If you would have asked me a couple years ago I would have been embarrassed to talk about it, now it‚Äôs pretty funny and cringe."
"I've exercised every day for a week now, and I am so proud of myself!","Great news. I'm in the same boat, I think a lot of my anxiety stems from being overweight. I'm 5'9"" and just under 14 stone. I got into a good routine end of last year/ start of this with going the gym and I did feel it help my mood lift. The past few months I've slacked (for one reason or another excuse) and reading stuff like this reminds me how I need to get back to it. When I got into it I decided to not focus too much in weight loss and focus more on how it helps my mental health."
When people say ‚Äútrust your gut feeling‚Äù means something so different to people with anxiety.,"My gut is always so sure that the worst possible outcome will occur that it's ridiculous. But I get it. Our brains see anxiety where other people don't, so it makes a kind of twisted sense that our innermost decision\-makers are living with the same fears and uncertainties as us."
"Telling someone with Anxiety to ""calm down,"" is like telling someone with Allergies to ""Stop and smell the roses.""","Or ‚ÄùIt will be over soon, try not to think about it‚Äù"
does anyone get really scared of being yelled at?,I've always been afraid of getting yelled at. Even if someone just raises their voice just a little bit I get teary eyed. It makes me feel so useless. 
I Stay Up Late Every Night Because Going To Sleep Means I'll Wake Up And Have To Deal With Tomorrow," I stay up, but for a different reason. My anxiety goes away at night, so I stay up to enjoy feeling normal as long as I can. "
Does anyone else feel physically weak and tired after going through a long period of anxiety that eventually died down temporarily?,Yes it is. You're exhausted. You're body's been in fight or flight all week and that burns a lot of energy. Eventually somethings gotta give and your energy eventually is gonna drop.
Who else regroups in the bathroom?,"I alwayyyys regroup in the bathroom. Perfect for either panic attacks or doing focused breathing to avoid a panic attack. I do have bowel issues tho, so no one knows if I‚Äôm in there crying or crapping ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Anyone have ‚Äúcareer anxiety‚Äù?,"Absolutely. I spent 6 years getting my masters, and I officially hate the industry I chose. I worked for a company for 7 years in the industry, only to be fired without cause (in in an at will state), and then pretty much reminded that loyalty is expected from one side and not the other.  
  
I'm now unemployed, and genuinely trying to figure out what I'm doing with my life. It's Best to have this happen when you're still young, like late twenties, than fifties I suppose.  
  
My point is, you're going to have issues no matter what you do. It helps to remember that a job is just a job."
I signed up for Reddit a year ago this December. It took me almost the entire year to overcome my anxiety about posting for the first time,I only just realized Reddit had as much as it does.   Being able to see I‚Äôm not alone in what I‚Äôm going through has lifted my spirits enough to back me away from the edge for bit.
"Has anyone found that their ability to read text, write, and spell drastically goes down when anxious?","Yes! Physically I get tremors, so I end up typing some wild chaos instead of the simple, human text I meant to get to. I can‚Äôt focus to read, either; I get really jittery and it‚Äôs like the last thing I wanna do is be tied up on reading."
I got rid of Facebook and Instagram today after 8 years.,"I deleted all of my social media 8 months ago. It was wild at first. Made me really reflect on how we grow to ‚Äúowe‚Äù the world a digital identity. People were so concerned i was off of it. I feel a million times better, I have never looked back. "
Dont you hate when you wake up and know its going to be an anxiety day?,"When I wake up and feel like it's gonna be an anxiety day I say ""bring it on, I'm not afraid"" and then proceed to not giving a fuck about anxiety. It's working for me. I control nothing, I'm fine with everything. Life is a wonder."
I get anxiety from posting/commenting on Reddit.,"I can relate, this is the second time I've ever commented on Reddit because of it."
"Toby Allen created these little cartoons called ""Demons of Mental Illness"". This is the one for anxiety. (I really hope it's okay that I'm posting this). Thought you guys might like it.",these were really neat. the depression one was kind of heavy. 
"Been awake since 4am, couldn't eat all day, major anxiety attacks ...was successful at my interview and got a promotion!","Congratulations! And remember, anxiety didn‚Äôt help you get this. YOU did it! Great job and keep it up!"
Does anyone else fear phonecalls?,Yeah I hate talking on the phone even if it's with people I know.. I have social anxiety idk if that has anything to do with that
I got a 4.0 this semester in college!,"I also suffer from depression and anxiety, along with PTSD. And I‚Äôve been a straight A student ever since I got back to school after a 2 years gap to seek treatment. I do notice that I have to work 5 times harder than other student to achieve this. It‚Äôs really hard to do well in school and fighting depression at the same time, but I dedicate my time into school to minimize the time I spend for negative thoughts. Congrats on your achievement. You deserve it!!! Be proud of yourself."
"People who laugh, yell, and mock the people with anxiety and panic disorders are sad people.","Makes me so mad when people say stuff like ""it's all made up"" or ""I just convinced myself I have it"". ""Or I just need to get out more"". It's so frustrating they don't even understand the half of it."
"Wake up feeling fine until I ""remember"" to feel anxious... anyone else deal with this?","Yea man, sometimes I'm walking feeling fine and I remember that I have anxiety and unpleasant body sensations from it and boom, I get them lol."
I posted the other day about getting a job. Today was my first day I was so nervous last night I didn‚Äôt fall asleep til 3:30 and I worked from 8am to 5:30pm. I am scheduled for 38 hours this week I think they liked me I am so proud guys ‚ò∫Ô∏è you can do it. Even if you‚Äôre craaaaazy stressed.,"I don‚Äôt mean to make anxiety sound trivial, I understand some situations can‚Äôt be powered through. I‚Äôm sorry if it came across that way."
does anyone get anxious around the noise of yelling?,I also feel this way and believe it is largely related to my anxiety.
I hope you guys like‚Ä¶get to live the life you want to live and I hope nothing haunts you for too long and I hope you‚Äôre all kind to yourselves. Let‚Äôs all hang in there.,Needed this. Been a rough couple days. 
Look for the helpers...,"I have trouble finding anyone who cares... I have friends who can empathize but they're too busy fighting their own demons. Then I have friends who can't empathize and they don't understand the magnitude of me not being okay. Then I have friends who don't care, especially since the majority of my friends are guys and I feel like they just text me back some days at the chance we can hook up. But some days I'll get a random text checking on me. Yesterday I had 2 people text me asking if I was doing okay. It made me happy, and also sad that I have to be checked on."
The worst thing for me about having generalized anxiety is I have anxiety about my anxiety.,[deleted]
Something I REALLY gotta get off of my CHEST!,"I read positive messages like this constantly, and my friends and family CONSTANTLY tell me to just keep going, take things one day at a time, you're doing great!  ... I just can't believe it.  I can't convince myself that I'm any good for anyone or at anything.  


Edit:  Who gave me Silver?!  Thank you!  This is my 2nd comment in a week and I've never had silver or gold in the last 5 years.  Thank you!"
The Biggest Problem With Anxiety is that It's Hard to Tell When Problems You're Having is ACTUALLY Caused by Anxiety,"Oh lord yes.  I have palpitations all the time.  As far as I know, not actual heart disease.  But maybe THIS time it is!  

Also don't even get me started on whether or not I really have hypertension and how bad it really is."
I hate it when being worried about anxiety related chest pains causes even more chest pains.,This is exactly how I feel about nausea! I sit there and obsess about all the possibilities it could be. Food? Illness? Panic? Random incurable disease? Focusing in on it inevitably makes it get 800 times worse blah blah rinse and repeat.
I start a new job tomorrow. Wish me luck üòÅ,"Good luck, friend. I start college for the first time in 15 years tomorrow. Should be asleep - terrified.

You got this."
"Anyone else feel so anxious yet they instantly ""sober up""/relax when other anxious people are in need of your emotional support?","It's often easier to help others with problems than try to deal with your own, since anxiety is often manifesting from an unconscious or subconscious place. But yes, this is something I've recently experienced. My sister is having emotional problems, and while I'm helping her, I get to momentarily forget about my own. Our parents fucked us up good."
"Anxiety is like having a toddler scream in your ear 24 hours a day. Zoloft is a set of headphones that lets you ignore it occasionally, but doesn't actually do anything to calm the screaming.","I think we just need to remember how different our experiences are from one individual to another. This is one person's experience on a certain dosage of Zoloft. Zoloft has changed my stepmom's life - she has done really well on it and that has been for years now. Sometimes it's important when we speak about this stuff - not to make it a blanket statement. Folks attribute a lot to other people's experiences and with meds, that's just not something that works!  
And there may be a medication that does more for you!"
One of my favorite phrases my therapist told me to keep in mind when I start to feel anxious...,"This sounds like Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.

Another good metaphor that I like is imagining yourself on a bridge looking below at 3 different trains on 3 tracks. One train carries carts full of your thoughts, one carries your physical responses to those thoughts , and the last carries your urges to act( e. g escape the situation). The idea is to try stay on the bridge without getting involved with anything on the tracks. Just watch the trains pass and just notice. It really helps to desensitize you."
Didn't go to a party due to anxiety and now I have anxiety because I didn't go,"You may try making a little pact with yourself before you go. Like, I'll stay for 30 minutes and if I'm not having a good time, I'll leave. Quite a few times I've done this, and when the 30 minutes are up most of my anxiety has subsided and I'll end up staying and having fun. Just getting out the door if often the hardest part for me. 

If you do decide to stay home, stick to it! Find something fun to do solo so you don't end up wondering what's happening at the party and thinking about what you're missing out on.

Good luck! As someone with social anxiety, I can totally relate to this."
Does anybody feel anxious to the point where they want to vomit?,Yea your not the only one 
Anyone else forget how to walk when someone is walking behind you?,"Yes. When I'm out in public I get very self-conscious about my posture, my gait, how I'm walking, etc..

I start fidgeting and I'm super uncomfortable. They don't just have to be walking behind me though, it happens when anyone can see me from any angle."
Any other chronic jaw clenchers here?,I try to remind myself every few minutes while I'm awake to unclench my jaw.
Slow down. It may feel like you have to keep up with the fast pace of everyone around you but you absolutely do not have to.,Calm and quiet scares me tbh :(
DAE experience 'burnout' for several days after one very rough day?,"Ugh, yes. I call it an anxiety hangover because it honestly feels so much like a real hangover sometimes. Low energy, often physically ill, antisocial, and the elevated baseline of anxiety. It's miserable."
"Just discovered this subreddit. Seeing all your posts gave me tears of joy, knowing that I'm not alone. Thank you all, your posts help all of us lurkers.","Hey, not problem man. This is what we're here for."
The Wheel of Anxiety (new comic I made),I love this.
Does anybody else feel mentally exhausted from battling with there anxiety constantly?,"Yes and even more yes. You're fighting yourself over your own body and mind. A civil war that never really stops. Peace occur now and then but there's always that one prick who start the shit once again. I'm getting better at maintaining peace however, easier said than done. 

Casualties happen, reinforcement arrive, circle of life."
Does anybody else find themselves clicking the 'discard post' button a lot because they are afraid of being judged?,"I rarely make it to that point at all. As much as I want to ignore it, the whole karma system + general vibes of certain subs makes me anxious to post anything. Most of my interactions are replies to posts or jumping into conversations, just feels easier. I think it has something to do with not being able to gauge your audience, if that makes sense."
Does really bad weather soothe anyone else's anxiety?,"I would be so happy to have a storm, rain, clouds, SOMETHING. It has been nonstop sunshine for nearly two months and it's driving me bonkers. I don't know why. "
A simple gif that may help you through an attack,"Saw this on the front page and thought it may help some people, I saved it for me when I'm in need of a distraction :D"
Does anybody else feel mentally ill with chronic anxiety?,"I have exactly this! My anxiety comes coupled with a hefty bout of insomnia as well, so I constantly forget really basic things, can't figure out simple problems, can't construct basic sentences and it takes me about twice as long as it should to get anything done. This is just speculation, but I think the amount of mental energy anxiety uses up leaves the brain tired and means you can't ever really feel like yourself.

So, yeah, it really sucks. And you're not alone :-)"
It‚Äôs that time again.,Im soooo bad with clenching my teeth.
Do any of you HATE loud sounds?,"I've recently become aware that I have an issue with competing noises or background noises.   They make me bonkers.  For example - if my kids are playing on a tablet and my husband has the TV on or if we're driving and listening to a podcast but someone is also trying to get to tell me something. Or if the baby starts crying while music is playing.    
Ugh.   "
Depression and anxiety together is the worst.,"Yeah, I had both of them but it was more of a depression than anxiety. But still, having both of them, 2016 was the most horrible year I ever experienced. I never thought, I would still be alive today, progressing in life with something. Sigh, I don't even want to look back at that time. \*hugs OP\* You'll definitely get through, If i did it all alone, you can too! It'll get way better once it's over. Trust me."
Today I managed not to look away when a girl made eye contact.,"no need to be shy and insecure around girls specifically! they are also human like guys are and arent some weirdos. just dont think about everyone liking you in some complicated way, be yourself, stay calm and act the way you like (be decent tho) and im sure you ll get many more smiles!"
This is what I have to say to my OCD anxiety.,"To ADHD/anxiety/depression mental cocktail:

Anybody else have anxiety attacks over mundane situations but feel totally numb over more serious situations.,"I freak out in certain situations.  Like being out in the heat (hello from Southern US), being in crowded places and such.  But if a big stressful situation arises, I can usually handle it without freaking out too bad.  I don't get it."
"Anyone else think they come off as rude in social settings because you're too scared to talk, resulting in silence?","Yes. I've been told before that others' first impressions of me were that I was stuck up because I didn't talk, so they assumed I wasn't friendly and thought I was above them. Little did they know I'm just a wound-up ball of social anxiety. :)"
I deactivated my Facebook and my anxiety had decreased by so much!,Deleted mine over two years ago and never once felt the need to reactivate it! Lost a lot of contact with old friends...just goes to show Facebook is far more important to people than actually being friends. My anxiety went down a lot after :)
My supervisor remembered my mood scale!,Sounds like a great supervisor. I hope your day improved
Does anyone else lose their appetite when anxious?,"This can be normal with anxiety. Your body is in ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù mode. It‚Äôs reserving it‚Äôs energy for ‚Äòbattle‚Äô essentially. 

Try to drink juice or something to keep your blood sugar in check. And if this goes on to be an every day thing, see a professional for advice!"
Does anyone else get anxiety when someone doesn‚Äôt talk to them? Like mine gets so bad like ‚Äúoh they don‚Äôt like me anymore‚Äù or ‚Äúoh they don‚Äôt wanna talk to me anymore‚Äù when that‚Äôs probably not the case. Idk how to handle it,"I actually struggle with this too, as I enjoy high interaction with one to two people at a time, if someone stops talking i feel like ive done something wrong"
Dont be me. A message to young people with anxiety.,"It‚Äôs not too late for you to turn that around for yourself. You have to want it, though."
"Its a saturday night, I'm at home and bored. I'm gonna go out alone and see if I have fun, wish me luck!",nice!! cheers to you mate
I asked to change the tv at the doctors,"Your next step would be to politely ask if they mind watching the news instead. I know that‚Äôs a huge feat when you have anxiety, but you are not a burden, and they may even feel appreciated that you value their opinion. Or another solution could be headphones and streaming something if that‚Äôs available for you. But I suppose that could also be counter productive if you‚Äôre trying to challenge your anxiety by staying connected with your outside world and not staying in a technological bubble. Either way, I AM PROUD OF YOU! :)"
"After years and years of putting it off, I finally made an appointment with a counselor.",Congrats! That‚Äôs a huge accomplishment. 
Something I wrote while experiencing crippling anxiety,"You have anxiety, anxiety doesn‚Äôt have you. It‚Äôs a part of you. 

Wishing you patience and presence."
"Does anyone else find that once you get rid of one source of anxiety, another will immediately replace it?","Yes. I‚Äôve recently noticed that my mind seeks out potential threats and fears. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm addicted to worry and fear. Once I‚Äôve taken enough punishment from one threat, I get over it and replace it. Somehow my mind ‚Äòneeds‚Äô to be fed with potential harmful encounters "
Probably gonna get lost in here.... but,This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen today! Well done you!!
"I did all my laundry, cleaned my room, and turned in all my assignments today.","Hey! I am in law school too! I also found out today I have a problem with absences. I talked to my Dean and she is going to speak with my profs. Are you registered with disability services? You may have options ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm proud of you for today, that‚Äôs such a good sign. Keep your head up and remember to love yourself through all of this."
I get anxiety during anxiety about myself wasting my life having anxiety and not being able to enjoy it. Wasting precious time. Literally anxiety about anxiety? How do I break this loop?,[deleted]
Who else is tired of anxiety?,"I am, too. Its tough when you're the only one who understands your anxiety. I feel that way all the time and I'm ashamed of it."
"hey, i noticed","I'm not talented, but I only want to live a normal and regular life."
To anyone spending Christmas alone due to their anxiety - hang in there.,"My entire extended fam is really wishing I show up today (in like an hour) but I'm 200 steps behind in life I just don't know if I can out of shame and respect for them. At the same time, my grandmother, etc isn't getting any younger and some of them don't get it, some do. Half of them and their SO's are doctors or hedge fund brokers and here I am in my boxers, unshowered on the verge of being dope sick. Ugh

&#x200B;

Merry Christmas"
"I love sleep. My life has the tendency to fall apart when I'm awake, you know? Ernest Hemingway",Smart quote
"This is me today. In fact, this is me most days.","Jeez I was there, man.  Year and a half ago, I was completely bent out of shape.  The biggest thing that helped me was to purposely focus on the positive.  Try to not get bogged down by the bad."
Did your child self think that your adult self would be completely confident and have it all figured out?,"Not sure if it helps, but I was just like you in my teens and twenties, but in my thirties everything changed. 39 now and honestly couldnt give a crap what anyone else thinks of me and I definitely don't feel like anyone is better than me or vice versa.
Keep going OP, you'll get there. üòä"
Just got engaged!,Congratulations! üòä
anyone else? -_-,This would go well in /r/depression too.
Im tired of people saying there has to be a reason why I'm anxious.,"Yes, there's a reason you're anxious. You have generalized anxiety disorder.

"‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt fly, then run. If you can‚Äôt run then walk. If you can‚Äôt walk then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.‚Äù Martin Luther King Jr","Thought this was gonna be the Firefly quote.

"Does anyone else feel straight addicted to their phone, even though you feel as though it just intensifies anxiety?","
Absolutely. I use it to distract me from my thoughts but it just exacerbates them sometimes."
Small victory: I managed to control a suicidal anxiety attack before it got too serious.,"Small victory??? More like HUGE victory!!! Panic attacks can be immensely dangerous to the mind and thus incredibly hard to escape. The fact that you controlled it, even if it‚Äôs just once, is amazing. I hope you have many more victories like this to come! "
Anyone else constantly have an upset stomach due to their anxiety?,"Yeah, same. My husband doesnt have anxiety and I told him I feel like I'm going down hill on a roller coaster....all the time. It's awful."
Worst time for an anxiety attack,I‚Äôm glad they realized what was happening and shifted gears.
Aced a phone interview and I CAN‚ÄôT STOP SMILING. PHONE ANXIETY SUCKS,Good job on the interview! Here's a upvote to celebrate
Does anyone else here creates arguments in mind and hypothetical scenarios which affects you emotionally?,"It's called Catastrophizing. I do it all the time and it's what broke my last relationship, as it made me depressed and anxious but it was my own head making up stuff that wasn't real. Or taking a scenario out of context and making it worse for myself when not the case.

For example yesterday my friends didn't sit with me at lunch. My head thought the worst, ""they probably hate me,"" ""they're embarrassed to sit with me"", ""they're fed up with the negativity you give off"" I made myself feel sick and couldn't finish my lunch.
My friend later messaged me saying she didn't see me at lunch and thought was I wasn't in the office, but no, I just sat slightly out of view. They just didn't see me.

If you can might be best to talk to someone about it or try some techniques to control your thoughts. It's not easy, trust me. But good luck."
Does anyone else feel completely disconnected from who they used to be?,I feel you so much. The thing that makes me more mad is that I cannot even remember how I came to be this way and how this way of living was suddenly the new normal for me. Like what particular day did this thing start and happen to me if you understand what I mean. I miss me too.
I looooove when you finally tell someone you‚Äôre anxious and they tell you you‚Äôre making it up.,"Oh just relax you will be fine. /s


This happens a lot and is actually why many people don't like to talk about.  I feel like I could be better if I could talk about my anxiety without being told to just relax."
"I'm so f**ing sick of being told ""just breathe"" when I'm anxious","You're focusing on the wrong aspect of breathing, though. 

""Just breathe"" probably has you thinking; ""well what the fuck...slowing down to breathe makes me just contemplate my anxiety more!"", but in reality you should be *using* the breathing, not just doing it as a go-to reflex when anxiety comes up. 

You have to breathe to empty your mind. You're not breathing just to do it, you're meant to breathe to give yourself something to focus on that will calm your heart rate and put you back in control of the anxiety you're feeling. 

...at least that's how I understand it so far."
Isn't anxiety great when all you want to do is sit around because you're mentally exhausted but your brain convinces you that you're going to get cancer/heart disease/fucking every illness ever from not exercising,Are you... me?
Does anyone else get tired of people telling them to exercise as if thats a cure-all?,"Yes, exercise works for me but only while I'm exercising. Therapist seems to think that's good news. "
"Does anybody else purposely listen to music they enjoyed when they were younger, as it reminds them of a time when they were not adversely affected by anxiety?",That's pretty much everybody over the age of 25 though. 
Does anyone else get really bad anxiety when it comes to talking on the phone?,"I have the same problem.  The phone rings and I get a knot in my stomach, my heart starts to race, I get nauseous, I begin to sweat, and I start to shake. 

This article has some really helpful tips on how to deal with phone anxiety:   [https://www.verywellmind.com/afraid-making-phone-calls-tips-3024317](https://www.verywellmind.com/afraid-making-phone-calls-tips-3024317)"
Anyone imagine who they could be if they weren‚Äôt crippled by anxiety?,"During my last session, I said something similar to my therapist: I miss the person I was before anxiety took over.

And she gave me a suggestion, or a coping technique maybe: ""Tomorrow try to do and think playing the kids game, *let's pretend*. Tomorrow, before doing or thinking something, let's pretend that you are still that person, and think or do what that person would do"".

I've tried, and I must admit it works a little. 

Maybe it can be a trick useful to someone else

Edit: grammar (sorry, not native speaker)"
Anyone else call in sick for work because of extreme anxiety and you're exhausted from trying to act 'normal'? And then feel really guilty? Argh!,"Yes!! I've done this. And then been exhausted by the guilt and additional anxiety about work I will go back to. But yes, the exhaustion of putting a face on has seen me call in more than once."
Does anybody else feel like your anxiety has totally killed your curious and creative mind? Read more inside.,"One of my hobbies is I'm a musician... A lot of the time my mind is focused on the fact that I'm not good enough and what other people think of the stuff I make (Especially when I cross reference stuff)... It not only makes me less creative but makes me demoralized and just want to quit all together so I don't work on stuff... as a result I don't improve and that feeds back into the problem. Its not just music either... but my university work too. 

In summary I feel this all the damn time and I hate it so much..."
"Does anyone else have this thing where if strangers laugh near you, they must be laughing at you?",I get this sometimes and I'm in my 30s. I don't think it's an age thing. I think it's related to social anxiety and that intense feeling of being judged by everyone....being hyperaware in social settings.
I finally did it!,GOOD JOB!!! SO PROUD!! PROGRESS <3
I‚Äôve applied for two jobs!!,"Good luck! I bulk applied (at least 50 or so) when I was looking and generally only ever got 2-3 interviews. Make sure you apply for something you want to do and not because it's A Job, and if they see your personality shine through and like it you've got it! If not well so what they're missing out on YOU!!!

(Edit: no way meaning to brag because that's not my intention at all, my point is I would worry so much about not having A Job and I was miserable at my first from underpayment and being abused by my boss and one of the managers and felt obliged to stay until I found something else, so don't feel tied down to a job if you don't like the work or the people!!!)"
to everyone reading this ...,"You too!
Best wishes!"
Anyone ever had anxiety that makes you not want to eat?,"Severe anxiety causes stomach issues for me similar to your description.

My anxiety had a daily cycle. Mornings were the worst. In the early evening it would let up until bedtime. I tended to eat a decent meal in this window of relative calm. Monitor your anxiety and see if that will work for you."
Going non verbal when you're upset/stressed?,"That sounds just awful!!!! 

When I visit my family over the holidays (or any other reason), they make sure to let me have my own room where I can escape to 

I get nonverbal when overwhelmed/overstimulated as well"
A week with no panic attacks!!,I wish I could upvote this a million times!! Congrats and keep up the good work!
Is it normal to have fun while drinking then feel depressed and over-analyse everything you did when you sober up?,"I find alcohol makes my anxiety flare up the day after, if I had got really drunk the night before. I didn't drink super often  but  the after effects I experienced mentally were bad enough to make me quit completely for a while. 

I agree it can be easier to come out of your shell, but for me at least finding balance with drinking was important. I have to drink slowly and don't ever get full on wasted anymore. The buzz helps me feel comfortable partying/talking with people/even singing karaoke but does not leave me with anxiety attacks or insecurity the next day.  

It's easy to over analyze yourself and your actions after sobering up. Can you talk to the people you were with, maybe get some reassurance about how they were receiving you? It can be anxiety inducing to have those conversations but if it's just you over analyzing, talking to them could really help you feel better. "

Sometimes I hate being alone but when I finally go out with people I can‚Äôt wait to go back home and be alone again. It‚Äôs like I want to be more social but then think maybe I don‚Äôt really want this. Anyone else feel this way?,"Yeah, I got tired of this cycle and just stopped trying to be social in real life, and I'm honestly happier for it. This might be an unpopular answer, people usually advise forcing yourself to socialize until you like it, and maybe I'm just wired wrong, but I just don't really feel a strong drive for company. Chatting with people online is sufficient. "
Does anyone else shut down when being yelled at?,"This happened to me a lot, but that‚Äôs because I  grew up with a dad who has anger issues, so anytime someone yelled or argued with me I would be filled with anxiety and fear and spend the rest of the time thinking how everything is my fault and how much I hated myself. 

I still feel like this at times but i just distract myself with video games or something until I calm down and collect my thoughts. I reflect on what happened and the other person‚Äôs perspective and that usually clears the depressive thoughts away especially if I go back and have a conversation with that person."
Downvotes make me extremely scared about what i said wrong,"I take downvotes really personally. I won‚Äôt even post in most mainstream subs because I‚Äôm so anxious about getting downvoted. None of this is healthy thinking, and I shouldn‚Äôt care so much about what other people think of me. And all of that‚Äôs well and good but, ya know, brains don‚Äôt always listen to reason."
Ever feel overwhelmed by the amount of evil in the world?,"I'm costantly overwhelmed by this kind of thoughts, and by all the nasty things my actual government could do more.

Sometimes, I am able to cope with it by thinking that I'm not alone in my disgust and fears, and if the times will come I will find other persons who'd want to fight and change things. It helps a little."
Does anyone else get anxiety when they are waiting on someone to answer them?,"I feel this alot. I always assume the worst: they hate me, I said something stupid, they secretly don't like me.

"7 tips for reducing your anxiety, without taking meds or going to therapy",Avoiding caffeine is so important. In fact it‚Äôs contraindicated for anyone with an anxiety disorder. I‚Äôm a social worker and studied the DSM 5 as part of my master‚Äôs degree. People with anxiety and/or who take medication for anxiety are meant to be counseled by their doctors/clinicians to avoid caffeine.

When you get anxiety because you finally feel relief from anxiety and you‚Äôre not sure how long it will last,"Absolutely. When anxious is your normal, happy is abnormal. So you question it. Questioning is an easy way to trigger anxiety because you can talk yourself into believing that irrational anxious thoughts are legitimate. Unfortunately the best way to get over this is to develop coping skills and use medication. When you can sting together a few weeks of being low anxiety or free of anxiety, it's easier to view anxiety as something that's manageable. When it's everyday for you, you think it's forever. Anxiety messes with the way you think and it creates anxious habits. Habits break when you stop performing them. Treatment and hard work beat anxiety, you just need to ensure the discomfort that comes with the process. Meds and therapy makes this process easier."
does anyone else watch TV/youtube to hear/see other people without actually socializing?,this is why i watch the office all the time.
What Anxiety Feels Like.,"I would just like to say...the fox/horse thing isn't a bad guy.  Anxiety makes us feel very put upon when other people challenge it because it is such an immediate and overwhelming feeling.  I feel like everyone out there who has anxiety should tattoo ""It's not his/her fault"" onto their arm because we tend to take it out on the people around us.

I have very situational anxiety, certain tasks are just incredibly difficult for me to do but to the average outside observer I look stress free.  My girlfriend has very broad spectrum anxiety but she has no trouble doing the things which paralyze me.  Sometimes when we absolutely have to be somewhere and interact with other people I have to push her and I never emerge from that battle unscathed.  However, on the drive there I'm a mess because driving through the city and being punctual are problems for me and I can get very frustrated and snap at people if they bug me while I'm in the car.  Eventually we realize how ridiculous we are being, we know it's not 100% in our control, and problems evaporate.  If we were just comforting to each other in our times of stress and never pushed each other to get past it we would never go anywhere, sometimes you need a push and you should be happy that you have people around you willing to push."
Does anyone else also understand that their thoughts are irrational yet they coninue to feel anxious?,"Yes! I know I am creating impossible scenarios in my head, but I still feel panicked anytime anything happens and I just read so far into every little word said and written to me. Some things really are what they mean on the surface."
"Living with anxiety is a lot like driving a car that idles high; you can still get out and go places, but you're going to run out of fuel much faster.","I definitely connect with this, it feels like social situations run me out of power, and need solitude to recharge."

I completely shy away from parties, large group hang outs, etc. I have been known to attend parties and then disappear quickly without saying bye to anyone. haha. i've accepted this about myself. i'm extremely friendly and open as long as it's a small group. i also love time alone.

Do you guys ever sit and run through things you've said today and hope you didn't upset or offend someone? Or look stupid?,"All.The.Fucking.Time.

I‚Äôm a people pleaser, 100%. I take an incredible amount of time to respond to people sometimes because I‚Äôm afraid of my words being skewed. Or if I feel as though I upset someone, I contact them hours, days, months, even years later and apologize for upsetting them or saying something the way I did. I spend too much time being indecisive because I want to make the decision that‚Äôll make others happy. It really got to a point where it was doubling my anxiety and making me depressed. This last month I have been working on doing things for myself and caring less about what people think of me, and so far my smaller victories have felt so liberating. It‚Äôs hard and I still struggle at times, but overall I‚Äôm much happier and care-free than I used to be, and that‚Äôs worth it to me. "
Shotout to those heading back to work today after a break,Needed this. Thank you friend.
"Anxious when I‚Äôm not doing anything, but too anxious to start because there‚Äôs so much to do","Oh yes, this is me alright. Or well, for me, there's like multiple angles of attack on my productivity, and this is one of them.

So I find that there's a few things that help me handle the anxiety. First piece of advice is to fully accept failure. It sounds weird, because not getting out of bed doesn't really seem like a failure, but the 'chain of anxiety' almost inevitably comes around to the thought of failure, no matter how abstract it is. If I don't go out of bed, I won't get to do x, therefor I fail by default. But if I do get out of bed and start doing x, then I'm almost certainly going to do something where I risk failing, (translation by anxiety:) so I'll fail anyway. This will lead your mind to go into this death spiral of 'doomed if you do, doomed if you don't', and before you know it, it's midnight and you hate yourself.

As a followup, the mentality I'm trying to teach myself is that ""Accepting failure is not the same as not trying to work for success. It's the opposite, as it will give you the strength to face failure and work through it. To trust yourself to be there, come storm or come sun.""

Which ties into nr 2, which is trust, in my experience. You need to learn to trust yourself, even if you don't feel like you've deserved it. I find that my anxiety is a lot weaker when I imagine myself standing up for myself no matter what happens. If I fail the exam, then I promise to study up and do it better the next time. If I pass it, well, cheers! To trust yourself gives you 'some solid ground to stand on', or that's how I think about it. Trust in other aspects is important as well. If there's a day you're sick, you need to be able to trust yourself without having to ruminate about whether you can get back into the work when you're better.

3, for me, is to keep in mind why I'm doing what I'm doing. A lot of the time, anxiety can be really really painful, and sooner or later there's gonna be a voice that goes ""why even do the thing if it's painful?"". If you haven't gotten your own intentions and desires in focus at that point in time, you will have to concur to that voice, ""I'm not sure"". Especially since losing sight of why something matters can mean that you end up going down routes you're not actually interested in. Like, making classical music because you think it sounds fancy and seems like a good challenge, rather than because you like to make classical music.

4, if you do get started, take anxiety breaks. You'll learn over time when anxiety needs to be 'handled' and when you should power through it. Generally speaking, all anxiety needs to be consciously handled sooner or later imo, but you don't necessarily want that sooner to be 'right now', as you're mid-work.

5, the other person mentioned the idea of starting small, and this is absolutely vital. It can be REALLY small, like, literally just opening the document or making sure that whatever you have to do to get started is extremely simple to get started on. Like, if you're writing a book on your computer, keep the file for the book in the center of the desktop or the like.

&#x200B;

These are just some of my own ideas, I'm still struggling with it all, but it's gotten somewhat better lately.

... Somewhat, heheh, aaaah fuck."
I'm not ok.,"You'll be ok. Don't be afraid to look for some help tho, your not as alone as anxiety wants you to feel. Its ok for your kids to see real life pain, would you want them to hide pain from you? I hide mine from my parents, which I learned from them."
I FINALLY did my dishes and I DIDN'T get Anxiety!,Good work! Go you.
Do you ever feel like your anxiety isn't bad enough to be valid?,"I was just diagnosed recently and totally understand where you're coming from.  I've always had certain trains of thought and certain habits that I now know are anxiety-related but they were just 'normal' for me.  Some of the stories I've read here have been so heartbreaking with what people deal with and then I look in a mirror and think ""you don't have it as bad as X, you can't have problems.""

&#x200B;

Yeah, brains are not our friends sometimes.  :(   Sending Jedi Hugs/ internet hugs your way if you need them!"
This is a reminder to anyone reading it that you ARE stronger than your anxiety and you CAN conquer this day.,Thanks. Mine is debilitating today and I still have an 8 hour shift to get through. I need all the encouragement I can get.
I gotta remind myself that it's ok to feel anxious every once in a while. I don't need to beat myself up for feeling this way. I don't need to find relief. Or so the reasons why I'm feeling it. Just accept it let it pass and life goes on.,"Excellent point. Worrying about anxiety often just makes it worse. It's better to recognize the situation and note ""I am sometimes like that. Traits of a genius, I guess."""
Does anyone else get anxious when plans are made or changed at the last minute?,Yes!!! It's ruining my life right now haha
DAE clench their teeth subconsciously??,"yes, all the time and while I sleep. It's starting to cause pain for me, which I guess means it's time for a mouthguard at night."
Does anyone else have this exact problem?,"Yes. That's very common.

I'd recommend asking a close friend or family member if they can help you book a time with your doctor or a therapist of some sort.

I find that the hardest part is getting started with the therapy process. Once I get into the habit of going, it gets much easier for me."
Does anyone get embarrassed over the littlest things?,"I'm sorry, Sempiternal9,

But i actually thought the whole scenario was so darn cute, i laughed in spite of myself.

I can't believe you hate yourself for being actually, very adorable.  Seriously!

I was the same way.. heck, actually every human feels the same way.  It's called the need for perfection..

I think, that once you get the hang of just knowing that you don't have to do EVERYTHING perfectly, that's at least a start.

I applaud you for several things:

1) You decided to go to the Opera House.  Many of us who have anxiety, can't even get out of the house because of it.

2) You decided to GO OUT and watch a ballet.. again. You didn't stay at home and watch it on Hulu or some other streaming service.

3) You dressed yourself.. Many of us can't even do that without criticizing ourselves right out of going.

4) When you slipped, just know it wasn't uploaded on Youtube, and broadcasted TransAtlantic, for $1.00 per click.

5) I can't tell you how many times i've slipped and said: *""You too!""*.. One time i said it at a damn funeral after someone told me, ""I hope you get over the grief of your mom, soon."".  

Just being aware of how critical you are of yourself, is growth.  And i will not even try to deny that people aren't ""judging"" you.  There are some that aren't even aware you are there.  And there are some that are.  Some people will think negatively of you, and there are those, like myself that will look at you, and appreciate who you are, inside and out.

Your main objective in life, my dear, is not controlling them.  Your main goal is to think highly of yourself.  When you start doing that?  You'll be so surprised at how much you no longer care what others think.

(There's plenty of YouTube videos and books regarding ""Not giving a crap what others think"") for starters. :)

"Anxiety is like the ink splatter in Mario Kart, it tries its hardest to blind me but I will always push through til it fades.",I‚Äôm gonna start thinking of this when I get anxious. I love this.
I just skipped an entire day of school because I didn't have homework for one class,"Hi. Teacher here :)

If your teacher is yelling at you, they are a douchebag and not fit for the job. Having said that:

I offer my students the opportunity to come to me before class and tell me if they have a bad day or such. I will then leave them alone (not calling them to show stuff on the black board or giving answers on homeworks). I will check in on them to see if they are better next week. I only have a stern talking to them if it happens more than two weeks in a row, as I found that some people need the external pressure to keep themselfes on track sometimes. If it happens not often, there are no questions asked.

&#x200B;

I am quite sure that not every teacher is open about offering stuff like this (I tell them when I first meet a new class). But I am very sure that teachers are human beings (just checked, heartbeat still there ;) ) and therefore know that life is shit sometimes. So if you go to the teacher before class starts and tell them you are sorry but you don't have the homework, maybe even try to explain it, they will not make a scene in front of the class. If they do, I'd recommend seeing someone about it and report the incident. (Which seems way out of the list of things you imagine possible when you're already anxious, I know, I know, but if you feel like you're up to it, it is certainly your right to do so.)

&#x200B;

And: If I knew my students would miss class because of something like that, I would be heartbroken. Please take care of your education, you're worth it! <3

&#x200B;

Edit:  Wow, ehrm, ok. Went to bed in Europe and woke up to all of these heartwarming comments. Thank you so much! <3 "

Y‚Äôknow those sudden times your heart just stops and get that overwhelming sense of dread?,"So here's the thing that is important to realize -- your heart is, of course, not stopping.

Here's what *is* happening:  do you feel your heartbeat right now?  If you do, your body is anxious.  You're not supposed to feel your heartbeat if you aren't exerting yourself through exercise.  Over time you've become so used to feeling your heartbeat that you now consider it normal and when your body finally relaxes enough to not feel it again you panic, which causes your body to stress out and you feel your heartbeat again. 

You can break this cycle, though, but it is going to require you feel comfortable once more with not having your heart pound all the time.  Relaxation exercises will help with this.  It is really startling to suddenly not feel it again but this is normal and how you were before anxiety changed it.

Also, feeling your heart pound like this?  Totally harmless.  It isn't a bad thing, it is just a different feeling and it can‚Äôt hurt you.  It is literally just a sensation ‚Äî your heart can absolutely pound much harder when it needs to!"

I haven't had a panic attack in over a month!,You are awesome! Wow I‚Äôm so proud of you and you should be proud of yourself. Go team!!!!! Keep it up:)
Does Anybody Else feel anxious when you are not doing anything?,"Yes, it happens to me. The feeling of being *unproductive* is mentally exhausting. Procrastination makes me really anxious.

What has helped me?

1. Find activities/hobbies that I enjoy doing that make me feel productive, or that I am learning something interesting, or that I am learning that can help me or can help others. For example: learning a new programming language, or reading a book about a topic that I am passionate about, or learn how to cook something difficult, or donate stuff to goodwill.

2. If I really want to do an activity that is unproductive (like watching a dumb TV show that I like, or assemble a puzzle, or play videogames), then I make sure I really like the topic of what I am going to do, and I only do it with moderation.

3. Another option for #2 is to do this activity with someone else. I am an outgoing extrovert, so I need to socialize to feel accomplished. If I am doing an umproductive activity, it stops making me anxious if I do it in the company of someone. In that case, fulfilling my need to socialize is greater than the worry of doing something useless, and I do not get anxious.

Shout-out to my cat for being the best anti-anxiety med there is,"I was never a fan of cats until I met my girlfriend and she had one. The cat is really jumpy and nervous but took to me straight away (probably sensed I'm just like her). Now she's my nap/snuggle buddy and sometimes I could cry with happiness when she cuddles into me and purrs. My girlfriend is away at the moment and all I want to do is sleep and make the time pass quicker, but it's really comforting having the cat; we look after each other."
Does anyone else have so much they have to do that they just end up doing nothing?,"Focus on one thing and try to get that done. One item by itself is stressful so it‚Äôs very easy to see how this is overwhelming. I deal with similar (but not exact) situations, I am a single mom of 2. The only help I get is a sitter (who I pay), as both my SO and parents live out of state. My house is a wreck and during the week I get very little time to do maintenance, so I spend a few hours on weekend trying to catch up, before the cycle starts all over again. It‚Äôs exhausting. I‚Äôm sorry. I hope you get everything smoothed out soon."

However, I often have to think that even though someone seems mentally well it could just be them faking it and they actually are suffering so you just never know. I feel like most people have some kind of problem whether its mentally, physically, family or relationship related etc. But I do sometimes think the whole 'why me' etc but at the end of the day its not a good way to think and wont really help or make a difference. I know you did say that you have come to accept it etc which is a good thing! So try to think that you could wish to be like someone else who seems mentally well but you may then have another problem to deal with. I hope this makes sense üòÇ"
Does anyone else not go on Reddit after they post something because they're scared of what people will comment?,"I'm actually surprised when people respond at all tbh.

I do take down votes far more personally than I should, though."
Does anyone else wonder how different their life would be if they didn't grow up with anxiety and depression?,"I get it, it often leads to the regretting of about 15+ years of my life, which snowballs the anxiety. But then a couple days after returning to baseline I realize that there are 0 things I can do about it, so I just need to let it go and accept where I am or force a positive change to make some long term improvements.

"Does anyone feel anxious about an hour or so before work and then when you begin, your fine?","Hi, yes I can relate to feeling anxiety before work. The hours leading up to and the drive there is almost unbearable. I hate the initial arrival part. You‚Äôre experiencing anticipatory anxiety. You‚Äôre subconsciously dreading the day ahead because of what could go wrong. It gets better once you‚Äôve been at work awhile because the hours passing is a relief when we are anxious. But when all that time lays ahead, we feel anxiety."
"I'm going to look at my bank account balance and work on a budget tonight. I've been putting it off for months, but no matter how much it scares me, I'm going to do it.",You‚Äôre not alone lmao
Is anyone else bothered by the gaps in the bathroom stalls?,"i was in the stall at a bar bathroom and realized I had no tp so I called out for some and a girl ran over and brought it, handing it over the top of the stall. Later on that night she recognized me out in the bar as the girl she gave the tp to.... so yeah, those gaps are way too damn big! "
"The brain doesn't care about being perfect - The psychology of perfectionism makes you feel meaningless, leading to self-doubt, perceived failure, and lack of confidence. The solution, research says, is to apply top-down ""frame shifts.""",I so agree with this.  I used to be a complete procrastinator because I thought I had to be perfect. My brain would go on overdrive telling me that if  I wasn't perfect I would make everyone mad.  I know this is illogical but it is hard making your brain shut up. 
I tackled my greatest fear and accepted a job!,"Congratulations!

I'm ashamed to say i did let out a bit of a giggle when i saw this.,It's definitely best to be able to laugh about it!
I have GAD and I do standup. Thought y'all might appreciate.,"Great job. You know how they say, it helps to have a sense of humor with mental illness, and on top of that, you're giving the anxiety the middle finger by doing stand-up. Really awesome."
"I did it, r/Anxiety! I went to the movie theater by myself!","I've been wanting to do this for ages but haven't had the courage to. 

Go you!"
I just paid a girl a compliment.,That's good!
Reminder of a few important unnoticed characteristics of anxiety you might have missed,"I found that doing activities that force you to focus on present moment has a lot of benefits for people suffering from anxiety.

Something simple as drawing had a lot of impact for me.

It is also very important to not focus on a target, doing stuff just for the sake of it. This way, whichever result will come out will not be frustrating."

I just unfollowed my ex on all social media,GOOD JOB. Best thing I ever did following my recent break up was on following and blocking my ex on all social media so I couldn‚Äôt go look unless I really made an effort. There is nothing you will see by looking at that person social media that will do anything but hurt you and make your anxiety worse.
Does anyone else fear that people you interact with might think you're insane because of how weird anxiety makes you act?,Yes.    Also I can't stop thinking that everyone hates me 
"My wedding is tomorrow, I‚Äôm gonna make it",Congratulations!!

"Im sick and tired of coming home from school where i rarely speak to anyone and just spending the rest of the day in my house but the thought of going outside, making friends and hanging out with them is too overwhelming for me",Try to join a school club or after school activity that interests you. You'll get to meet like minded individuals and might even make a new friend. You won't always have to socialize and you have something to focus on when you're not. It's also something good to put on your resume when you apply for jobs for the first time.
Does anyone else feel so overwhelmed all the time?,"I feel this. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm always expecting something bad to happen. 

Anxiety has changed me so much. I used to be pretty easygoing and I loved life. Now I shy away from conversations, I can‚Äôt watch or listen to news or movies that are even the slightest distressing, I freak out over the smallest tasks given to me.

I‚Äôm hoping this all ends soon. It‚Äôs been months since I started feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. It isn‚Äôt a good place to be. Hope you‚Äôre well"
Can someone give me positive vibes for my midterms tomorrow?,"You got it. Relax tonight, drink some chamomile tea, do whatever you do that helps you clear your mind. Get a good night's sleep. During the night your mind will deconstruct and analyze everything you studied and help you see angles you never saw before. Try to arrive early and make sure you're not rushing tomorrow. If anything goes wrong, you'll figure it out. You have what it takes. "
"If someone tells me to ""just calm down"" one more time I swear to god .","Like people telling you ""it's gonna be alright, just stop worrying"" when you're depressed."
Remember: You are strong.,I needed this. Thank you.
Does anyone else miss their old selves? Before anxiety and depression messed you up?,"I've always had anxiety since I was a child, but it has worsened in my late 20s and early 30s. I miss the social aspects. Being able to and wanting to go to bars, concerts, friends' homes, wherever without feeling dread or anxiety. "
Anxiety being added to qualifying conditions for medical marijuana in Pennsylvania,For me pot is always a gamble. I haven't used in a few years because I never know if I'll feel better or if it'll make me more anxious and paranoid. I hope they disclose this side effect to people who have never used before and are looking for anxiolytic properties.

If he valued his job he wouldn‚Äôt have risked losing it by harassing you. It‚Äôs unlikely that you are the first person he‚Äôs done this to. Hopefully, you will be the last. "
I have no title for this. I'm scared. I made this.,"this is really good. i tend to draw sad dinosaurs when i'm having an attack. my friends never see the sad eyes, but i guess that's because dinosaurs aren't very good at expressing themselves."
I‚Äôve deleted my last two posts on here because my anxiety tells me everyone will think it‚Äôs dumb and stupid. Anyone else?,"No, I've only posted on here once or twice and I only deleted them months later as part of a general ""clean up the profile"" purge.

This is a sub of anxiety sufferers. No one thinks anxiety symptoms are dumb or stupid. We all have them.

I'm terrified of aquariums. I'm a grown man with a son. I'm a college graduate. I'm terrified of aquariums. How fucking pathetic is that? I'm not gonna judge you."
I didnt had anxiety today and im the HAPPIEST man on earth,"Hey, that's great! Keep up this positivity, man. I've been passing through my second day without anxiety, getting better with breathing slowly and deeply when I feel that I'm starting to get anxious.

It‚Äôs my birthday! I confidently talked with many people today despite my social anxiety! Hooray!,"Happy Birthday, and congratulations on all the successes you achieved today. Great work!"
After 5 years of anxiety depression and daily panic attacks I‚Äôve decided enough is enough!,"The way I see it is learning to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. Stoked for you! Staying busy is an excellent/productive distraction from my own anxiety even if it means just working, eating 3 square meals a day, and walking the dog"
My anxiety comes in waves of good weeks and bad weeks. I keep a diary and on a good week I wrote out a list of bullet points for me to read when I'm having a bad week,This is such a good idea! And this list has honestly helped me as today hasn‚Äôt been good at all for my anxiety. Thank you for this :)
#metoo,I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through this. This is something no one deserves. I‚Äôm very proud of you for sharing I can‚Äôt imagine how hard it‚Äôs been for you. If you would ever like someone to talk to whether it be about these things or just a simple chat please do not hesitate to PM me. You deserve to be happy. 
Pok√©mon Go Is Helping People Deal With Social Anxiety and Depression in the Most Amazing Ways,"Even with Pokemon Go, I'm far too anxious to talk to anyone. I walk around with my phone out and all, but I still avoid people. I only go to a pokestop with a lure if I can find an inconspicuous place to sit. Whenever I go to gyms I get super nervous that a member of another team will show up and get in my face about how the gym is theirs or something. I haven't been able to claim a gym because of the 1hp glitch so my Pokemon are weak compared to the people around here and that somehow makes me anxious too.

I'm glad it's helping some people though. :)"
I felt apart in front of her,She sounds like a keeper. I‚Äôm glad you found a safe space to share your emotions ‚ù§Ô∏è
Calling in sick gives me massive amounts of anxiety,"this is my life 100%. I feel like even though i'm telling the truth, they still think i'm lying and it sucks. I would say the only way to help yourself feel better is to just relax, maybe get a note from a doctor?"
I finally made a doctors appointment on my own!,"That's awesome! 

I use an app to book my doctors appointments as I have trouble making calls too. 

Good on you :) "

I've been going through a bit of a rough patch with my anxiety so maybe we can help each other! Love you guys!",What a nice offer. It certainly helps to speak with other people who understand anxiety disorders and 2412124733 don‚Äôt just think you‚Äôre being dramatic or exaggerating. If I could tell you the number of times I‚Äôve been told to just not worry. Now that my anxiety is under control I go out of my way to make myself available to family members and friends who are struggling. We lift each other up and encourage each other to keep fighting because conquering the anxiety monster is possible!

Last night I went to a club alone (and loved it). A few years ago I could barely leave the house.,"That‚Äôs amazing!! Im so happy for you :)

My absolute favourite part about that type of music is the crowds that listen to them live. Raves are the one place I feel comfortable and free from judgement, where I can just let loose and have fun dancing all night. It‚Äôs like therapy for me honestly. "
Does anyone else get random lapses of ‚Äúcontentment‚Äù where your mind is at peace before the anxiety comes back?,Yeah totally. Theres times (very slim margins) where I feel amazing. I walk slow and look around in awe of how amazing the world is and etc. Usually short lived and I go back to an anxious mess wishing for it to stop. Comes in waves I guess
"For the first time ever, I ran with my SHIRT OFF!","Happy for you!

This made me smile,People want to be our lovers? Now that's some anxiety.
I wrote a bit of a poem about self-doubt. My therapist advised that I share it.,"I don't know how this hasn't received more responses because I thought it was great and very accurately represents the experiences of an anxious mind! Really nicely done, and kudos to you for being willing to share something personal such as this. Thank you üíì"
Does anyone here think sometimes that everyone secretly hates them but is only acting nice to them to not be rude?,All. The. Time.
"I got over 50 downvotes on a comment I left as a joke, and cried because I thought I hurt people's feelings","I feel ya. If I get downvotes I generally delete my comment. It's hard for us sensitive folks, this online stuff!"
Anyone have to pee a lot when they get anxious?,For me I get gas and I have to poop a lot. Often times I take Immodium before a job interview or public speaking session to keep my tummy from rumbling constantly.

"Does anyone else not consider Sunday a ""day off"" since you spend it in a constant state of panic thinking about the next day and week?","Yes! I have never liked Sundays, I feel I need to use the entire day preparing for the upcoming week. I often end up wasting the day worrying or just dreading the week, rather than doing something fun or accomplishing tasks. "
If you're about to get your day / morning started remember this:,"If the day isn't a day you've mastered, you've all day tomorrow to do better. 

Most importantly, be kind to yourself. Life is hard enough"
"After social interactions, namely at work, I get a lot of anxiety thinking about what I said and people‚Äôs reaction to it. Keeps me up at night (like now it‚Äôs 3am). Specifically I think about how stupid a comment I made was, how desperate I must have seemed,and other negative things. Why is this??","Because you care too much about what other people think about you. People do not give a shit about your ""awkward"" moments, comments etc. and even if they notice they will forget about it pretty soon. Everyone has their own issues and they always focus on themselves. 

I used to care about my public speaking anxiety (i was a litigation laywer) until i literally just stopped giving a fuck. I saw a lot of 40+ people sweating and getting nervous in court when they were about to speak up, but nobody arround them ever seemed to notice or care. Its all in your head.

Nobody remembers or cares about random shit. Sure if the situation was indeed awkward or weird or whatever, some people might make fun of it. Should you even give a fuck?

Fuck no!


Edit: Wow! First time i receive gold! Thank you kind stranger!"
"Deactivated fb, it was damaging me mentally. No one has even noticed!","The only thing that keeps me up on facebook are college groups and to be honest it's the only way to contact people, because no one is eager to even respond to my sms._.
Besides that, long time ago I deleted instagram and snapchat. What do I get from those hundreds of likes and fake friends? Only jealousy and this sick desire of being appreciated by the people I don't even talk to. "
What people think is a cure for anxiety is actually one of its causes.,"That‚Äôs exactly what many books on anxiety tell you to do. By not ‚Äúgiving in‚Äù to the anxiety, we train our brains to not go into panic mode. Our brain believes what we tell it. So you‚Äôre telling your brain that it‚Äôs just anxiety, nothing terrible will happen which strengthens your reaction of not panicking! I hope I‚Äôm clear. This is great to hear. Now, if I could just be as disciplined as you!"
"I got drunk for the first time in over 6 years this weekend. My anxiety is now so bad, that I am considering suicide.","Anxiety after alcohol consumption is actually fairly common. 

I know it sucks, but it will fade after a week or so. "
"Headed into a store to grab a game that wasn't on Amazon. The workers were too friendly and kinda freaked me out a bit, I was nervous the whole time, but I made it in and out. Woot.","Las time I went to a shop was on Thursday to buy earbuds, I was sweating bullets and shaking, couldnt even talk. Managed to buy the earbuds though"
DAE ever feel like you are rushing through the day to get home to do nothing?,"Yes, and it makes me depressed, too.  I know that if I start doing things that I like again, that I'll feel better, but I feel like my anxiety drains me each day to the point where I just have no motivation at all to do anything.  It makes the days go by too fast, I feel like I'm missing out on life.  How I fight this?  Literally force myself to start doing things I like, or new things.  Like going to the gym after work instead of going home right away, cooking my food instead of getting fast, drawing, music, etc."
I looked after myself today,"That‚Äôs awesome, you should absolutely be proud."
I just talked myself down from an anxiety attack!,"yaaaaay well done you! My anxiety turned out to tell me if i don't want certain things or want to get out of certain situations. I wanted out of my relationship, I wanted out of my old job. I would never have actually left those things behind if my anxiety hadn't made me stand up for myself. I was raised to be a ""people pleaser"" and now I'm working on finding out what I really want (and that shit is hard!). Congrats on not letting your anxiety control you!"
I'd like to share with you a picture that helps my confidence.,[deleted]
I am just average and adequate and that's ok!!,You're awesome and you'll do great! We believe in you and wish you the best! üíï
"Ever since I got blue hair I've realised people weren't looking at me before. They are now, and hopefully if I go back to my natural colour I'll be able to remember the difference","Bonus - eventually you get so used to people looking at you that you don't even notice or care, and if you do notice you know why so it doesn't give you anxiety! 

(I had brightly coloured hair for years, I don't really get any 'they're staring at me' anxiety at all now and haven't for a good few years)"
My anxiety hurts,Yep. Tightness in the chest or the stomach. Weird tingles make me think death is imminent. Hot flashes cause me to need ice packs on my head. Can't even watch a show to distract myself because I'm so restless and uncomfortable. Anxiety is brutal.
Increased anxiety/ruminating thoughts when your life isn't as busy?,"Yes!! Usually my depressive thoughts get worse when I have time to ponder, with anxiety worse during the term. However, my anxiety does make me feel guilty whenever I‚Äôm calm."
I wish I could give my anxiety a body so I can beat its ass.,Lol oh my god this is perfect. I‚Äôd fight that peice of shit to the death
Neuroscience study finds that being sleep deprived alters neural pathways that lead to increased fear acquisition mechanisms. How a lack of sleep fuels anxiety related symptoms.,"This makes a lot of sense, from anecdotal experience. I've always found that my bad days (anxiety, irritability and depressive behavoirs) often follow a night of poor sleep. 

Frustratingly, this can become a feedback loop for those, like myself, who suffer insomnia as a symptom of anxiety. Best solution I have found is to take some form of sedative about an hour before bed, whether that's a prescription, or OTC like benadryl. "
Has anyone here ever screamed/felt like screaming from how anxious and overwhelmed you feel? I need someone to understand,"I‚Äôve felt that way before but instead of screaming I go for a drive with music blasting loud and sing my heart out. Usually helps me feel better, plus no one around can judge, win win in my book. Idk if that helps but sending a hug your way!"
does anyone else wake up with a sense of impending doom upon you?,"I sure do. I wake up at 4am every day. Sometimes I get back to sleep for a little bit, but mostly toss and turn. When I finally get out of bed I will play some music on my phone to fill the air, drink a glass of water, and meditate for 5-10 minutes after a shower. That seems to help calm me down a bit."
Anyone else waking up with anxiety?,You're totally explaining my life right now.  With the added bonus that my anxiety keeps me from falling asleep because I'm afraid it'll still be there in the morning. A night of sleep used to help me clear my head and now it seems like the anxiety builds up higher every morning.
I started writing poetry about my anxiety as a form of coping,You're pretty good at it.
My therapist of 4 years just passed away... I want to celebrate him. He helped me through my worst years.,holy shit this was intense to read. I'm sorry for your loss he sounds like a great person
Unsubscribing because I need real help and this sub isn‚Äôt really supportive,"I think one thing this sub needs is to focus on helpful info and how to‚Äôs. Sharing articles, techniques, etc.  I think that‚Äôs infinitely more helpful than just shouting into a void like op mentioned.

Edit: Guys this kind of took off so I‚Äôd like to suggest, we should post things that help us. YouTube videos on techniques. Links to books, worksheets, etc. I love seeing success stories but share HOW you got through it, not just what you got through. In essence, be the change you want to see. 

I‚Äôm also a member of r/stopdrinking. I‚Äôve got 5 years sober and I would not if it weren‚Äôt for them. For examples, come check it out, just to see how it operates."
"sorry if this has been here before, I just relate so much.","Oh I've been there, and yes it has stopped me from purchasing something. I've gotten better, I think a lot of it has to do with how I approach the situation LOL. 

I sound nutty."
Looking back at my life I realized that I had stopped living life. I was literally just trying to get to the next day.,[deleted]
"The loneliest feeling in the world is having a panic attack at like 3am, with no one else home, and it feels like the whole world is asleep and you‚Äôre the only one awake.","Been there. It feels like hell in that moment, like you'll never make it to morning "
My tattoo; a little serotonin for when I'm lacking,"Ok that's cute - approved it shall be!   

I have the barcode of a twinkies box on the back of my neck :)"
"Why do I get ""text back"" anxiety?","I get the reverse: ‚Äúafraid to text back‚Äù anxiety. I work two very fast-paced, socially-intense jobs, and when I have a moment to recharge, I hide and cower in my room and attempt to calm myself down. If someone texts me, I think, ‚ÄúOh, what do they want? Do I have to respond now? Is it important? I‚Äôm trying to shut out the world. How do I phrase my response? I can‚Äôt think straight. What if I just wait til later when I‚Äôm more mentally composed to respond to this?‚Äù

Not everyone‚Äôs like us, but maybe if you try to imagine they‚Äôre going through the same thing, it might help."
posting on Reddit gives me anxiety - so this is me fighting that anxiety,"I've often held back on posting for similar reasons. That it's not original what I'm saying or that I'll be attacked for what I say. I'll take forever re-reading what I've typed to make sure I've made no mistakes, double checking that no one could possibly take what I'm saying the wrong way or disapprove

I can't really offer any advice on how to get over it, just wanted to let you know you're not alone, and that your voice is equally as valid online as other people's. 

I think that social media, as great as it can be, can easily have this negative effect, as most carry some form of 'approval' system... which isn't all that great 

It's really awesome you got the confidence to make this post by the way. Congrats :) "
I got my first 'real' job and survived my first day--8 hours--without letting my panic take control.,"fuck yeah, you went for and then got a job you wanted (a huge thing for *anybody*, let alone someone suffering from anxiety), and you powered through the first day (again, often pretty overwhelming even for someone who doesn't have anxiety) without having a panic attack. that is awesome on all counts."
Valentine‚Äôs Day should also be a reminder of SELF-LOVE,This is a hard exercise for me... Thanks a lot for your reminder. Happy Valentine's
Anyone else afraid of texting?? I tend to leave so many people on read because I don‚Äôt know what to say. I think if I continue the conversation I‚Äôll just end up bothering them...then I end up coming across as rude ):,"I go the complete opposite direction and send too much. 

I get worried that the first message i sent wasn't good enough / was weird so i oversend which tends to piss people off and then make it worse haha

I'm curious to see in future if texting has any impact on mental health"
I hate calling people,"Jeeze I really hate the phone too, to the point that if I have to do something over the phone, I put if off for, sometimes, *weeks*. I prevents me from keeping in touch with my family as much as I'd like, as I always get super anxious before I call them, or when they call.

> If I tell them I don't know, they seem to get frustrated at me. Sorry that I don't know everything.

If they really get frustrated, screw them, doing stuff over the phone isn't ideal for anyone involved, there's no reason for you to say sorry! "
I made a small accomplishment today! I managed to go to the gym alone.,That is really great! Anxiety can make our world become so small and every step we take to press the boundaries out takes so much courage.  I hope this gives you confidence to continue to challenge your anxiety and to continue to be so brave.  You should be so proud of yourself!
After 6 months of struggling to get a job I‚Äôve finally done it!!,And it did brighten my day! It's awesome you're sharing this beautiful moment. Go on! Best of luck for your new adventure!
Guys if anyone is out there I‚Äôm feeling really small and deflated and I just found this sub for the first time I just wanted to say that reading your posts is so heartwarming and you guys all seem so nice üíïüíï,"I started visiting this subreddit around a week ago and I wholeheartedly agree. Normally, Reddit triggers my anxiety, but /r/anxiety reminds me that I'm okay. It's ironic that a subreddit about anxiety happens to be the one that has helped me combat my anxieties."
"Friendly reminder to anyone in the the US (yes this includes cali and florida, you're not exempt): if you have anxiety or depression, this is the time to get tested for low vitamin d and possibly start supplements. Winter blues are upon us folks","Also for Canadians, as northern climes mean shorter daylight spans. Canadians, try ordering Vitamin D3 from the US if you, like me, see only 1000 IU bottles in brick-and-mortar retailers. When I lived around the 48th parallel I started 5000-10000 IU a day from November to March."
"Is it just me, does anyone else‚Äôs chest feel tight and have a slight headache most of the day every day?","Yes, sadly. Also comes with slight off and on dizziness."
Anyone get anxious about calling out of work?,"I do, I think it‚Äôs somewhat normal. It‚Äôll be ok, you have the right to call out. "
"Sometimes anxiety tells me everyone will hate me and laugh the moment I am noticed, but then depression tells me that no one cares about me enough to even feel such strong emotions like hate....","I have both right now. One minute I don‚Äôt want to talk to people cause I want to be alone, but the next, I‚Äôm stressing out about how they hate me..."
"Anxiety is the sensation that nothing has ever been okay, and never will be.","But that feeling is a lie; it eventually passes. Hang in there everyone, it gets better üíö"
"Does anyone else get terrible anxiety from movers or cable guys coming over into your space? It completely depletes my energy, as if I ran for miles. Serious fight or flight mode.","Absolutely. Like you said ""coming over into your space"". I don't even like people that aren't family or close friends in my home, at all. Not even all of my family are welcome to me at home. Strangers though? Can't stand it, constant anxiety and worrying."
Anxiety is like when video game combat music is playing but you can't find any enemies.,"""You cannot sleep when enemies are nearby."""
Anyone else distract themselves by going on the internet?,"Obligatory ""are you me???"" I have ADHD as well as anxiety so I can lose myself for hours watching random shit on Youtube. It's incredibly unhealthy and I'd say I'm addicted to the internet; most of the time that I'm using it I don't even enjoy what I'm doing - it's almost like being in purgatory, where I can momentarily forget how shit my life is, yet simultaneously feel too guilty to do things that I actually enjoy."
"When my counselor told me it's usually ""smart"" people who develop anxiety (x-post from r/adviceanimals)",We are totally circlejerking our intelligence in this thread. 
"Question: do you guys pretend to like things in order to fit in and be accepted and liked,so much so that you don‚Äôt even know what you actually like anymore?

"If I‚Äôm more than 2 minutes late, I often don‚Äôt go to a class out of fear of what others will think","Going to class when late is hard as hell, but missing class then trying to go to the next one is exponentially harder. Already did that to one of my classes this semester. "
I got a job!,Congrats! Is it your first job? Asking because I'm looking for a job and wanted to know if you can give me any tips
Frequently i will put headphones in and then forget to turn music on. I think it's because that little bit of muffling helps me calm down and think straight. Kind of like a little hug - it's comforting. Anyone else do this? or something similar?,"Definitely. I think it helps cut down sensory overload. 

I found a really good, kinda related tactic to calm down while panicking recently. My SO had put my head to his chest and covered my other ear, which muffled everything. All I could hear was his breathing and his heartbeat. Works pretty quickly and effectively for me."
"Today is a really, really, really, hard, no good, bad day.","I feel like this too. It's ok, you're ok, everything is ok."
I check to make sure my alarm is set at least 10 times before I go to bed. Anyone else do this?,"I have OCD, sounds like an OCD thing."
I just gave my number to a girl!,"I am a woman who suffers from anxiety but as a counter point to one of the other comments, this is actually how I PREFER to be approached in public by someone who is interested in me. I feel the way you went about it is the optimal way to approach a woman tbh. By waiting until just before she got off the bus and handing her YOUR number, you did two very important things: 1) Gave her an immediate ‚Äúescape‚Äù in the event that she WAS uncomfortable and 2) Put the power in her hands so that she could CHOOSE whether or not she wanted to have further contact with you. This kind of interaction would not only boost my confidence and make me feel good, but I would really respect how the person did it in a way that didn‚Äôt make me feel awkward or cornered, which typically happens when I‚Äôm chatted up by some random dude in public. In my eyes, this was a perfect, respectful interaction so kudos to you OP!! And I‚Äôm so proud of you for being SO freakin brave too. "
I utterly hate it when someone tells me that I am wrong. Not because I want to be right but because it makes me feel that I am an idiot or inadequate,Well. This is pretty relatable.
When anxiety makes you want to do things but depression makes you want to stay in bed,Fire and ice. It‚Äôs a bitch.
Anxiety as an older male sucks,"This is the reason anxiety in men disproportionate manifests as anger issues. Society allows us a handful of acceptable emotions and everything else is weakness. And an excuse for other males to abuse us inorder to maintain their place above the bottom rung in the man box. So we get conditioned to rely entirely on the fight response. As flight is not an acceptable outcome. 
 And if we are lucky enough to avoid that conditioning, we get labeled a weak coward. And made an outcaste or punching bag for the man box. 
The things we need to manage our anxiety healthily are also denied us. Things like a supporting community, platonic physical affection, and positive emotional outlets. You are labeled as gay, or a bitch if you try to express anything beyond anger, lust and hunger. 
The point is, don't let society lable you. Be who you need to be. Find people that support it. And you'll find your own strengths

Update: Small edit for a typo. And just wanted to clarify something. As upon re reading I realized something that I said could be read a certain way.  Being gay isn't in itself a bad thing. Rather it's another method of exclusion and domination used by the Man Box inorder to force this brutal peking order on us. Anything that is outside the very narrow definitions of masculinity that our society uses. Will be used as such.

If anxiety is keeping you awake right now...,I needed this :) Im up at 6 am without sleeping at all and feeling anxious all night. That made me feel a little better though. Thank you
Shout out to all the S.O.'s who accept us,"I hear you man. Mine just drove me home from a gig I was asked to do. I played, then ten minutes after I stepped off stage I was a wreck, shaking, unable to catch my breath. She drove me home, made me tea, put me to bed.

I don't know how she can put up with this mess but damn, I love her more than words can say."
Be aware of your distorted thinking,"I think I knew some of this, but having it written out if fantastically helpful, thank you so much for this post!"
Anyone else with anxiety have a crippling fear of confrontation?,"Yes, but for me it's because no matter what I said growing up, I was always wrong. No one ever listened to my side and when they did, I was still wrong even though I was right. I get scared that it will escalate into crazy violence (That's how mum reacted when she knew she was wrong and still wanted things her way) and it's just stuck with me. I can argue with my boyfriend. We get into silky arguments though over things and luckily we both deal with it maturely. There's no yelling, no swearing, no meanness or anger, it's more like a debate where both sides will have their say then we deal with it. I guess that's the healthy way of dealing with things."
I went to the store by myself today,"Fuck yes!

Man I remember when I was like that, simple things being super scary and impossible. It's still like that sometimes, but it's better now. You'll get there. Celebrating and being conscious of the little achievements like this is how we get a handle on this mess. Good job!"
I immerse myself in TV shows like Scrubs and How I Met Your Mother to make up for the absence of real life friend groups.,"I think this is extremely common. Even with people who have great, supportive social circles. The way the groups of fictional characters interact is a sort of hyper-reality: more meaningful, more emotional, almost mechanical in its efficiency. And when they teach each other lessons, they also teach you. In something like an episodic show, the ""lesson"" is both introduced, explained, demonstrated, and expanded upon in the same episode. Real life is rarely so neat.

I think you would be extremely hard-pressed to find someone who did not at some point wish they were part of a fictional group of friends and also in a small way feel like they were. 

I think if you look at works of ficiton that have large fan fiction communities, you will find elements like this. People sort of fall in love with these people and don't want their stories to end. By continuing these stories its like they get to hang out with their fictional friends some more. I think it's a really important part of the magic of fiction. People often say the characters are what make the story but many people don't understand why. It's because properly developed characters aren't just lifelike, they are more emotionally affecting than a real person can be, because they are engineered to be so and their whole world bends to them being so."
Take a moment to breathe.,"That's a good one. I would prefer the out breath to be just a smidget longer, the way the triangle stays for a second, but otherwise it's a nicely calming tempo."

I had a panic attack at work today in front of a room full of patients,"Just want to remind you that it‚Äôs ok to be upset when someone gets angry and shouts at you. It is one of many normal reactions to that situation.

I was so upset after a man got angry and shouted at me once, I felt very threatened. I had to lock the door and cried and cried and went home in the end - and I‚Äôm in management. 

You handled it well and covered the desk, and went to your supervisor for support, well done. Panic / anxiety attacks are scary when they have happened, you are right to think it through and come to terms with it. Don‚Äôt be ashamed of what happened, and don‚Äôt feel alone!"
does anyone else have an extremely chill side to them,My only two moods are extremely calm or extremely anxious. No in between.
"Anyone else with ""high functioning"" anxiety?","Not sure what you mean but I was one of those who was ""too good"" to have anxiety. I was very ""well informed"", I understood how anxiety works and had the basics of CBT down, I knew I ""just"" had to expose myself to my fears and all that. In the end, for me, I just realized all that was some kind of denial and prolonged my healing further. I think one of the reasons I got anxiety problems in the first place was because I had incredibly high demands on myself.

Anxiety has definitely humbled me over the years and I don't live for perfecting everything and achieving new goals all the time anymore. I realized they only mattered to myself anyway, and made me a less human and fun person to be around.

&#x200B;

In your case it sounds bad when therapists doesn't take your anxiety seriously though. I hope you are able to find a good treatment plan."

"DAE feel the sense of ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù so often, every week they‚Äôre surprised they‚Äôre alive?","Man I tell ya, it‚Äôs crazy.
I can‚Äôt tell if it makes me appreciate life more afterward, or just produces constant existential anxiety. Like, a couple weeks ago I had a panic attack so bad that afterward I seriously was surprised that I was alive. I‚Äôd accepted my fate in the moment, but it was never a fatal situation. Just all in my head.
Then, the whole next day is like a panic attack hangover... I‚Äôm just in a daze like ‚Äúdang. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm still here. This is weird.‚Äù"
When you have so much to do so you‚Äôre stressed and anxious. But you‚Äôre too depressed to do anything.,"Often people say that when they are anxious because they have to do something it's also kind of a positive, because it forces you to be productive.

In my case it's the opposite though. Because I'm so stressed out I never actually get to doing the things I'm supposed to."

but yeah. you aren't alone. i am sorry you feel this way, and that i didn't have any advice to give "
I‚Äôm sorry if this gets asked a lot but... does anyone else feel too ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to not have a mental illness but not ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù enough to actually have one?,"Err... I mean, too normal to be mentally ill, but too crazy to be sane. "
Does anyone else feel like they're just a nuisance to other people?,"Can I double upvote?

It's exhausting feeling like a nuisance 24/7. I get to the point where I start to warn people I'm a nuisance before they find out themselves as I've got it in my head that'll it'll hurt less if they realise straightaway that I'm a terrible person rather than later."
I finally made an appointment with a therapist!,Just had my very first session last week and loved it! I hope the best for you
Does anyone else find job searches paralysing?,"I (28M if it matters) get this exact same way when it comes to work. I'm not afraid of work, I grew up helping my dad and grandpa mow lawns, split wood, fix cars, I know I can physically work but as soon as I start thinking about jobs I get crippling anxiety. I've quit at least half a dozen jobs within the first week only because I panic and cry in the car the whole way there. I also have no idea what I want to do I just know I don't want my depression and anxiety to prevent me from working and supporting myself. I'm super embarrassed I'm almost 30 and live at home and can't hold a ""real"" job. Not to mention all those jobs I quit can't go on a resume so now I have massive employment gaps which makes it even harder and scarier to apply for jobs."
Stop clenching your teeth,Tell that to me when I‚Äôm asleep. Love the headaches
Does anxiety make you nauseous?,Thrown up in very inconvenient situations. Yes lol.
Anyone else get a vague sense of dread and emptiness at night?,Yup. Fucking empty lonely and hollow
I get why people with mental health problems don't tell others about,"Everytime I tell my family about my anxiety, they tell me to just stop worrying and that I should try not being stressed out. Like, holy fuck, I didn't know it was that easy."

Does anybody else disassociate?,"Definitely, I get really dizzy and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm high. Usually the build up to something worse."
Is it possible to have constant anxiety without any attacks?,"I fell like that's my situation. I almost never have a what I'd call an acute attack that goes away at some point, but I spend almost all of my time in a low-level state of dread and worry."
Anyone else get really worried and restless ~2 hours before having to leave the house?,I can‚Äôt sleep when I know I need to be up early. I also can‚Äôt drive most days. I think I‚Äôm going to hurt someone in an accident then I Uber and then I eat myself for being weak.

Has anyone ever vomited from having such high anxiety?,As a teen every single morning before school. I would sit in the bathroom and puke my guts out cause i was so anxious about going to school and being beat up or bullied more. This all stoped once i left school. Though if i get really worked up i will still get nauseous once in a long while.
"Your feelings are uncomfortable, but they are not dangerous.","A year back the statement like ""Just be with your feelings and watch your thoughts"" sounded dumb to me. Because you know when you have anxiety you obviously cannot make even tiniest decision and always in rush to get out of the situation whatever it takes.

But after practicing mindfulness for almost an year, i have realized that watching thoughts and being with the emotions no matter how it feels are such a powerful thing and a real game changer."
Fuck anxiety.,Just don't tell it that to its face or it may like argue with us or something.

That‚Äôs not how this works...,"Yes and the only thing that worked for me is to stop talking to them about mental illness, sadly."
When i‚Äôm out in public by myself i feel like everyone is watching me and it makes me hyper-aware of my movements and extremely uncomfortable?,I used to go through this really bad everyday. Luckily it‚Äôs gotten better over the years. One thing a past therapist told me before is to just think about how often I study details on strangers and make rude judgements about them. So I started focusing on how I think about other people. For the most part it‚Äôs usually like ‚Äúthose are cute shoes I wonder where she got them from‚Äù or other harmless thoughts like that. I just have to keep reminding myself (and this is gonna sound terrible) that‚Äôs there‚Äôs nothing really all that special about me for people to focus all their attention on. That‚Äôs always helped me the most.

You‚Äôre not weak if you ask for help. You‚Äôre not any less of a human being if you show your emotions. You don‚Äôt deserve to be in pain everyday of your life. You don‚Äôt. It isn‚Äôt your fault that your mind is telling you what it is. It‚Äôs not.,"Totally agree. And your thoughts are NOT who you are. They are a component of you. Thoughts are observable but we are often trained to just ""Feel"" them. They do not define you, they do not control you and it's OKAY to have these thoughts!

Thoughts are like a river running through a garden. You can be swept away by the current, or you can sit on the side and watch the thoughts go by. The river is only a small part of the garden and you are the garden. It takes a lot of practice and effort, and i will never pretend to be a master of it, but those moments I've been able to remove myself from the water and simply observe the thoughts pass by, unrestricted, not fighting them. OBserving them. I felt a peace that no benzodiazapine was EVER able to give me."

My mental illness makes me feel childish and immature,"I definitely feel often that my avoiding any situation that would make me uncomfortable has really stunted my growth into normal adulthood in terms of relationships, career, even just hobbies. It‚Äôs hard to feel like a fully formed grown up when you feel like the everyday parts of that life which are supposed to be fulfilling are actually a tiny personal hell. For me it‚Äôs just been a long series of little moments of pushing myself just a bit past where I‚Äôm comfortable and trying to build those new experiences into something that reinforces the view that those experiences are positive rather than negative. It isn‚Äôt easy, and it‚Äôs still taking a ton of work even into my mid 30s, but the little progress I make keeps making my life a little better and makes me feel a little more like an adult."

Just read this article about Anxious Depression and boy did it hit the nail on the head,"Yep. I have every single one of these symptoms. Every one. Quiting all substances and being extremely mindful of my thoughts is helping a lot. And actively trying to mould my mind to not do these thing.

I think being particularly aware of substances, diet, exercise, sunlight really is sooooo important. When you do these things, it's harder to work out whether it's your mind that is irrational, or the nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, hangover. Etc.

Good luck, and thanks for posting! "

Anyone else feel psychological pain is worse than physical pain?,"Yep I swear, I've been through serious asthma throughout my childhood and I remember back in the 6th grade I'd sleep with low respiration and I'd wonder if I'm gonna die in my sleep because of the lack of Oxygen but I remember I've never thought about my condition during the day, I'd play, have fun with friends, skip classes, do dumb shit, come back home and play video games, get out and play, it was beautiful even thought my physical illness was serious. Anxiety on the other hand sounds like a joke to other people yet this crippling anxiety hijacked my life for the past years, the worst part is that we know deep down that modern science doesn't have a cure for it, in other words we're fucked. Physical pain is there you can't do nothing about you give it meds and it goes away, it's not like anxiety where you're told to cope and keep overthinking about the whole thing, hell on earth."

"I would rather do nothing at all times and choose it over going to work, hanging out with friends, and taking classes. Am I alone in this? How do I stop self sabotaging?","I struggle with this exactly. I was a little concerned that by blaming it on anxiety I was making a convenient excuse to be lazy but then I had somewhat of a break through moment with my therapist. She said people with anxiety can lack motivation because we're ""all or nothing thinkers"" for example when I have a headache I immediately jump to brain tumor not something more likely like needing to drink more water. So when it comes to tasks like studying or assignments we think we need to either complete it all now or at least dedicate HOURS to it NOW, rather than something more realistic like 20 min. So if we can't dedicate ALL we do nothing. Her advice to me was to look in between all or nothing and just do SOMETHING even for just a few minutes and to not be so hard on myself for not doing it all."
She said yes!,"Good job man. I am glad to see that it worked out and that people here helped you. It's amazing to see an internet community help one another like I see so often on Reddit. 

Hope all goes well for you and best wishes!"
"In August, I had my first panic attack in years.  In September, I started drawing.","These are the first thirty (or so) pages of my ongoing journal/comic.  

I have posted the first couple pages a few times in comment threads, but this is the first time I've given this project its own post.  I recently scanned some more pages from my first sketchbook, and I'm feeling brave enough to share tonight.

**Some background:**  I needed this project to be stress relief, not a source of stress.  

These were (and are) my rules:

>Draw when you want to, when you need to.  Not when you feel you ‚Äúshould.‚Äù  

>No pencils.  No erasers.  Just create, and don‚Äôt agonise over the mistakes.  

As a result, there are many mistakes.  But there is also, I think, a lot of beauty in them.

It's helped me a great deal.  I hope some of you can find it helpful, too."

Post Drinking Anxiety,"Totally. When I‚Äôm hungover I cannot even look at my phone for fear of what I might have posted on Snapchat or Instagram or whatever when I was out. Aside from that, I can‚Äôt look at other people‚Äôs stuff on there either because it just makes me feel sick and nervous. Also just overthink everything from the night before and wish I hadn‚Äôt drank. "
My dreams are even anxiety ridden. It‚Äôs exhausting,"Yup. It is. Welcome to the club.

It sucks.

I frequently have anxiety nightmares. I did find that no caffeine after 7/8pm helped a fair bit, but it doesn't stop them entirely. I wake up utterly exhausted and drained from them. Then I get to spend my day worrying too, which is also exhausting. Yay."

"Therapy requires money. And to get money you need a job, but you can't get a job because you have terrible anxiety. What do people with anxiety really do? They're in a position, it seems, where there isn't a way out. This seems like a dangerous place to be","Hiya. You ask a very good question. To answer it, there may be free or low cost options near you, if you're interested in going down this route. If you're in the US, I respectfully suggest taking a look at one of this subreddit's Wiki pages on getting professional help. The guide I will link has a step-by-step guide to find a therapist and/or psychiatrist in the US, regardless of one's insurance/financial situation. Here's the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/wiki/gettinghelp#wiki_how_to_find_a_good_therapist_and.2For_psychiatrist

Another option that may be worth looking into would be a free support group in your area. Even if you're not interested in joining a group, I recommend contacting the therapist or organization facilitating the group because they may be able to refer you to other free or cheap resources in your community. You can google the name of your town/a nearby one + free support groups. Or, if you're in the US, you can use psychologytoday.com's support groups finder (https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/groups).

Lastly, if this is the first time you'd like to seek help and you have any questions (like what types of questions you would be asked by a professional, how to prepare for a first appointment, how first appointments usually go, or my personal experiences with professional help), then don't hesitate to ask me. Feel free to ask anytime!"

My anxiety has made me less feminine,"I‚Äôm a guy but can totally relate. I intentionally dress hardcore *norm*core in drab, earth colors with plain shirts and old New Balance shoes just so I can be as unnoticeable as possible. 

I use to wear bright yellow Jordans and other noticeable shoes with flashy, stylish clothes. I even had a badass fur coat (fake but it was so expensive because it looked 100% real) that I loved wearing because I got a lot of compliments and was warm AF. Lol

But depression & anxiety has caused me to want to fly under the radar as much as humanly possible.

If you have to , warn them before hand, Explain your anxiety and say  ""if I ghost you on day of it's because of my anxiety"" "
Anxiety is having a multitude of people scream at you to move a pile of burning tires and you're sitting there begging them to wait until the tires aren't on fire anymore.,That's a very beautiful way of describing such a difficult concept to explain.

so anxious i can‚Äôt sleep and then i get anxious about getting no sleepüò©,"I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre having trouble sleeping. Are you seeing a therapist about your anxiety issues? 
I‚Äôm not a specialist, but I‚Äôve dealt with bad anxiety  myself and have developed some coping strategies throughout the years (big thanks to my therapist at this point): 

‚Ä¢ *Meditate and build awareness*

Not being able to sleep at night is mostly because of anxiety that has been building up throughout the day. Whenever you feel even slight discomfort, will to escape a situation or just general stress/anxiety, try to bring yourself back to what is around you. Headspace is a great app for guided and almost unguided meditating, download that and work yourself through it. 
Focus on your surroundings, on your senses and on what is happening _now_. 

‚Ä¢ *Do breathing exercises*

There‚Äôs a breathing exercise I know from singing, but it has helped me ease anxiety attacks many times. Inhale for some seconds (let‚Äôs say 2-3), then hold your breath for 2-3 secs., then exhale for another 2-3 secs. and then keep your lungs empty for another 2-3 secs.. Repeat that for about 5 minutes, or as long as your body will need to just focus on its vital functions and get away from the turmoil in your head. This is something you can always do before going to bed also. 

‚Ä¢ *Make yourself tired*

This worked for me at least. I would exhaust my body so much throughout the day, that when I went to bed, my body would almost immediately just collapse and fall asleep. This might not work though if your anxiety is too acute, 

‚Ä¢ *Develop sleep hygiene*

Get Matthew Walker‚Äôs book ‚ÄúWhy We Sleep‚Äù and try to implement all that he says. Build a sleep routine and avoid electronic devices, too much mental stimulation, food, etc. before going to bed, let your body prepare to shut down. I myself am super guilty of not really following the advice yet, but I‚Äôm working on it. Build the habit of removing yourself from avoidable stressors before bedtime and it will be a whole lot easier to relax. 

‚Ä¢ *Absolutely go to therapy* 

All those things I just wrote, are techniques on battling the symptoms mainly. We want to find the root cause of your anxiety, that‚Äôs not something you can achieve without a specialist (I think!). Find a therapist and work through your problems, have the courage to confront yourself with the issues that leave you restless and tackle them one by one. 


Anxiety is horrible and it can absolutely affect your life in every way. You might feel lost and desperate right now, but I can assure you that there is a way out, I can assure you that those problems you have and the often ‚Äúunexplainable‚Äù feeling of anxiety have a root which you can 100% identify with a professional. You can do this! Remember, at the end of the day it‚Äôs just chemistry, you can regulate it, balance it and understand it. It‚Äôs nothing metaphysical that is here to punish you, anxiety is a messenger and you should listen to it and act! 

Wishing you all the best there is, DM me if you need someone to talk to ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Wish me luck! I‚Äôm going to the gym and I will be fierce,You got it! I'm rooting for you :) all the best
Update: went to the first day of work and everything went well!!!,Hey Op I just wanted to let you know I was likebl you two months ago. In January I tried commiting suicide but the months leading up to my current job were also rocky. So then I got hired at my new job by a friend who works there and they are so accomodating to my anxiety. Not only that but every Thursday they let me take 2 paid hours off to go to an anxiety group. It makes me happy to see people like you and I making progress!
Anxiety is not being able to enjoy ANYTHING because you‚Äôre worried about that thing in 3 weeks that will actually be way less awful than you imagined.,And knowing that it‚Äôll probably be less awful than you‚Äôre expecting only helps for a fraction of a second
‚ÄúMommy‚Äôs doing something weird.‚Äù,"I found meditation through reading; ""The Miracle Morning"". My now wife didn't know what to make of it at the time but she's since accepted that I'm ok when I shut myself into our bedroom with the lights off and a soft soothing voice is dominating from my phone. üòÑ"
I made my first phone call in years !!!,"Good job.
I bet you'll be able to do it."
Getting nothing done today: ‚úî,"It's okay, these days happen. Just because you didn't place a brick today doesn't mean all the bricks from yesteryear suddenly vanish. Just pick it back up tomorrow and focus on placing more bricks, with time they eventually create something you care about. "
"Screw you, anxiety. I won.","Congrats, man!"
Today was one of the good days and I don't have anyone to share it with...,"Congratulations!üéâ‚ù£Ô∏è That is huge and you're right to be proud and claim victory!  Overcoming anxiety is always something to rejoice over.
I wish you many, many more positive experiences like this! You, my friend, are on your way to good health. Xxoo üíì"
Anyone else panic when the phone rings?,"If it's my personal phone, I just don't answer unless I know who it is. If someone wants to talk to me that I don't know, they can leave a message and I'll get back to them. So no worries there. 

If it's my work phone, I'm supposed to answer it and help the person with whatever their problem is (not my primary job but I'm supposed to be a back up to help out since we have a small team). So it's definitely not my thing and I get a little panicked I won't be able to help them, do it wrong, look stupid, etc. "
Does anyone else imagine someone is critiquing their music while listening alone?,"i can‚Äôt listen to music in public unless i know it‚Äôs ‚Äúpopular‚Äù, i can‚Äôt watch movies / tv shows on the tv if there are other people home and i can‚Äôt answer a phone call without going outside or far away"
"I'm hoping after I seek help for my GAD that I can leave myself alone. Do you guys know what I mean? Any imperfection in my skin results in me making a mess off it with picking and pulling. üò¢ Does anything help distract you from doing this, those of you with the same tendencies?","This is kind of weirdly eye opening for me because I've done this to my hands for as long as I can remember and I never really attached it to anxiety, I just thought it was a bad habit that I just did for no reason until my fingers would bleed"
I cosplayed for the first time today.,That is a big deal and you should be proud. I‚Äôm happy for you!!
"Not sure if repost, but I feel that this sums up my irrational fears pretty well.","She doesn't want to go to work,

But she doesn't want to stay in bed,

To something else instead."
I can tell when my anxiety is high when I start making silly bets with myself.,Saaaame didn‚Äôt think this was a thing
Anxiety sucks,"true, good post"
"I Didn't Get the job, but I'm proud of myself for trying","It's hard to put ourselves out there, especially when applying for a job. You do have a lot to be proud of. Keep up the great work!"
How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself,I wish i could upvote this 1000 times! Thank you so much! Ive never seen such a solid plan of overcoming anxiety
Does anyone also hate nearly everything they‚Äôve ever said?,"I've stayed up nights agonizing about stupid things I said at work that day. I try to tell myself no one but me remembers, but I just can't let it go."
Having anxiety and depression simultaneously is somehow caring too much and too little about things at the same time,"Good insight!

For me it starts with the anxious thoughts about all the things I want to do, say, etc. and then the depression sets in due to my inability to actually follow through on all these great things I've got planned in my head.

It sorta goes along with the idea that happiness/success/fulfillment/etc are found when your thoughts/beliefs are in alignment with your actions. When they aren't in alignment is when the depression rears its ugly head."
Anyone else who day dreams of living freely on a tropical island with no technology at all?,"Not a tropical island, but i daydream about living off the grid in the mountains.  What i find are far fewer people and far less expectations.  The exact opposite of where i am now. (l.a.)"
That feeling in your chest when your phone rings,This why my phone will forever stay on silent.
I had a good day today :),That is awesome.  May you many more good days.
Does anyone else get anxious when they realize they‚Äôre not anxious?,Yes. thanks for reminding me that I'm not anxious now...
Does anyone else ever feel ‚Äúnumb‚Äù or detached?,"Maybe look up depersonalization or dissociation. It is a way we unconsciously cope with anxiety. You could try grounding exercises. I get this and have found that sometimes just challenging that unreal feeling by making a conscious movement. Take yourself off autopilot, pull over (I get it driving), get a drink, splash some water on your face. Hope that is helpful."
Literally anyone: ‚ÄúJust calm down!‚Äù,"Holy shit this has to be the most annoying thing anyone can say to a person having a panic attack.

They don‚Äôt understand! You don‚Äôt have control over it. If I could calm down I would not have GAD and panic attacks daily.

9 Hacks To Get A Handle On Your Anxiety Right Now,"Just want to say that it‚Äôs okay if these ‚Äúhacks‚Äù don‚Äôt work for you. Almost none of these things help me during a panic attack, and some of them even hurt me (music makes me zone out and have moments of derealization). Find things that work for you. Other options (for people maybe more like me) are to listen to podcasts. Hearing stories is super helpful for my panic disorder. It keeps me grounded, and it‚Äôs also entertaining. Games and apps on my phone help if I‚Äôm having a panic attack at work. I can take a 10 minute break to play some Pok√©mon Go or Hearthstone, something familiar and comfortable, and then get back into the swing of things."
Does posting to reddit make anyone else anxious?,Yes because at least one person usually treats me like crap and the confrontation makes me very anxious. 
Hey people i think im overcoming anxiety day by day.,"Congratulations! The ""retail therapy"" is probably contributing a lot, throwing you into the deep end and forcing you to confront your anxieties on a daily basis is probably helping you overcome them mentally. I hope you continue to improve and get stronger."
I went to my appointment!,"Ah yes i fear bloodwork too. It seems whenever I bring up my anxiety and meds they wanna test for my thyroid, (which yes I understand) but it‚Äôs never been my thyroid it‚Äôs just me. But any new doctor always wants to draw blood"
I can‚Äôt even work up the courage to post on reddit.,"Ooh, yeah! I also happened to me the first time I posted here. And also happens whenever I post something on Instagram. I always get the idea of deleting my posts cuz it makes me think people won't like my posts or comment on them."
"Finally after 8 years of severe anxiety and daily panic attacks I have finally got to the point where I no longer take daily medication, and am basically ‚Äòcured‚Äô.","Thank you for writing this out 

What things other than what you have written down did you try/do and what do you think made the biggest impact on how you are feeling? 

Also its so nice to have a reminder that we can get better sometimes it doesn‚Äôt feel that way "
I have made a subreddit dedicated to providing people comfort after having a bad dream. I have stress related bad dreams almost daily which is a product of my anxiety. Check it out if that's something that you suffer from too.,Omg! You are the best! This happens to me WAY too much! Thank you!
Does anyone else get angry when they're anxious?,Yup. Anger has been called anxieties' ugly cousin. Anxiety and frustration go hand in hand.  
I finally finished all my homework without crying,"Good going, every victory counts."
I‚Äôm finally going to get help for the first time in years. I made myself a appointment to the doctors and I‚Äôm going to finally talk and seek some help.,That‚Äôs really awesome of you to reach out for help. I hope you find the tools to help you!

Coronavirus Megathread,UPDATE: there is now a Covid-19 room on discord. https://discord.gg/jHhT64
"It‚Äôs overwhelming how members in this group help and support each other, this is just crazy, happy to be in this group","I think it's because we've been there. We can relate.

We know what it's like not being able to breathe in certain moments. We know that staying in is sometimes preferable than going out. We understand being alone can feel better. We know there are certain triggers and certain things (or nothing at all, GAD sup?) that set you in a downward spiral. 

And there are some of us who made it through. The few who live with it daily, welcome it as an old friend, and maybe share the tips that helped us cope with the ones who are still struggling. 

Knowing, feeling, and understanding the struggle are the best ways to help someone else cope with what's going on. 

We're here for you. I'm here for you. "
Anyone else feel more confident in certain clothes than others?,This one red t shirt. It‚Äôs nothing special but with a good pair of jeans shorts I feel amazing. I also feel awesome in my hoodies.
Does anyone else have EXTREMELY tense shoulders?,"Sit on a yoga ball. It opens up the pelvic floor, which prompts your body to unclench and sit in better posture. You‚Äôll be sore at first (because you‚Äôll be using muscles you generally don‚Äôt when clenching your shoulders) but it helps relax them and re-train you. 

I‚Äôve had horrible tension headaches for years and just found out it‚Äôs my shoulders causing it, and they‚Äôre always tight because I am always in a state of anxiety and clenching my jaw and shoulders."
Does anyone else get torn between wearing a really nice outfit and wearing something that won't bring much attention?,"Ill get a little dressed up, look at myself in the mirror, think what others will think of me, then undress and put on a mostly all black outfit. I do it way too often "
Does anyone else‚Äôs anxiety make them feeling like they have a fever?,It's very common. Worrying about it is a sure way of making it last longer.
"Anyone else experience getting ""butterflies"" throughout the day with no apparent reason?","Yep this happens to me a lot, you are not alone! It‚Äôs not a fun feeling anymore lol. Usually makes me nauseas."
Fear of growing up and getting a real job,"I‚Äôm in the same boat as you, I‚Äôm so terrified of adult life, I‚Äôm still in school with one year left to graduate but I‚Äôm at a risk of failing all of my classes , that it might push back my graduation date which causes me to have mini panic attacks almost everyday ,"
I am on Lexapro and it feels like I started a new life.,This gives me hope. I‚Äôve recently accepted I don‚Äôt think I can fight it with therapy alone
Lately I‚Äôve been putting off sleeping because I‚Äôm so anxious for the next day,"Hi there. It's currently 2:30 am and I am in the same boat. I do exactly what you said. I stay up until my eyes can't take it. Unfortunately I've been like this for as long as I can remember and it's my version of hell. In the past I was taking magnesium to help me sleep and it worked BEAUTIFULLY, but because of my medication I can no longer take it. I'm back to shitty eyes on the walls until next thing I know it's morning. I'm sorry I can't help, but I will say you're not alone. Good luck and maybe talk to your doctor about magnesium."
Do any of you pace around when the anxiety gets bad?,Yes! I actually use pacing on purpose as a technique to get rid of panic attacks.

"a friend said to me, ""hey, dude, I think that's just your anxiety talking.""","A part of beating anxiety journey, one of the first steps  is that you have to learn that being anxious is normal at early stages, and no you don‚Äôt need to have a solid answer for the cause of your anxiety.

Accept it the way it‚Äôs. The brain works differently for anxious people and its normal for them to feel so, with the proper treatment you‚Äôll discover that being anxious is a part of the early treatment."

But yeah, I‚Äôd say keeping busy all the time is the way to avoid this - but then being busy  with hobbies/work all the time starts to present its own problems. There‚Äôs no winning really. I‚Äôm sorry this comment has been no help lol but I‚Äôm right there with you!"
Anyone else freak out over the smallest pain or symptom in your body?,Yesterday I ate too big of a piece of watermelon and got it stuck in my esophagus that led to really uncomfortable chest tightness. Took an antacid to try and settle it down and that made me throw up. Google ‚Äúchest tightness and vomiting‚Äù and it says you‚Äôre having a heart attack. I woke up today 100% back to normal so I‚Äôm hoping I can use this example in the future to stay calmer when something unknown happens. 
me irl,me too thanks
I did it!!! I went out to dinner and didn‚Äôt get any anxiety! First time I‚Äôve had a genuine smile in 2 years,Congratulations. Keep on keeping on
I DROVE TODAY - big win!!,Excellent üëèüëèüëè

Anyone else get driving anxiety?,"You're definitely not alone! I haven't learnt to drive yet mainly because I just don't need to but I would be anxious about it too.

Something tells me you'd be a very good driver though! You'd take care, mind out for other road users and wouldn't cause any issues because you wouldn't do anything crazy!

Just because you feel anxious doesn't make you crazy or an idiot! If you need to talk to someone about it, we're all here for you :)"
I just hope everyone has the best day they can today!,"Thank you for this.  We‚Äôre leaving for home tomorrow from a vacation in my husband‚Äôs hometown.  I hate goodbyes, and my tumbly has the wumblies. Ugh. üòû"
"Anyone else overthink before posting to social media and therefore, never post at all?","Yup. And then when I do post something I'll probably delete after a couple of hours. But nowadays I rarely ever post on Facebook or instagram. I can't be bothered to deal with the overthinking and the anxiety I get from wondering what replies I'll get, if any, etc."
Ate in a restaurant alone for the first time. Win!,Congrats! That's a hell of a win!
"Anyone else get anxious when receiving GOOD news, because clearly this ain‚Äôt real and the shits about to hit the fan?",I got an award for teaching excellence and it threw me into a weeklong depression/anxiety episode.
Suicidal ideation is like an annoying brother you have to bring along on errands,"I get it the worst when I'm driving. Like oh hey what would happen if I just... That or you get home after a non specific day and dream of taking all the pills. Or even a dramatic day, that you know will end and be better and still dream of pills..  I would never. I couldn't. I know it'll get better but I still dream of it.  

Maybe I need help. "
I just ordered food on the phone for the first time :D,[deleted]
I am sure some of you can relate to this...,YES
DAE read messages they're about to send over and over again,"Yup, I do it!! And I‚Äôll still manage to find a rogue spelling error the second after I hit send ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"At my worst I feared the night, when the sun started going down my anxiety would go through the roof, I would beg the sun to stay up but it never did. A massive shout out to all those fighting your own battles. Sending you love and hope.",I am the exact opposite. I fear the day coming around and take a lot of comfort in the night and darkness. My bed is pretty much My Sanctuary and I fear the mornings. Stay strong.
A small victory!,Congrats!...these things seem insignificant but are actually great victories!
Does anyone else get a huge amount of anxiety when someone knocks on their front door randomly?,"Totally have the same, I‚Äôve just stopped answering the door unless I am expecting people or a delivery. 

It‚Äôs made it much better although I still feel anxious when I hear the door and turn my tv or music down in case they hear. Then after about 15 mins or so I try to just carry on like nothing happened. "
Followed the sidebar to my local clinic......nevermind,"Imagine MONTHS of suffering through the worst OCD and anxiety you've ever faced, finally getting the balls to call, no answer, leave message. NO CALL BACK. Twice.

The absolute worst.

Anyone else replay over and over in their head stupid things they've done? How do you get out of that funk?,[deleted]
A comic I made about how i've been feeling recently :(,"I fling myself out of bed if I have to, because I know deep down that If I stay in bed I'm not gonna feel any better. Sure my anxiety might get worse because I have to go out there and face the day but it was gonna get worse laying in bed anyways so fuck it."
Success :D,Way to go!
I'm kind of mean when I have anxiety,"Anxiety and anger are directly linked. I know I get easily angered with high anxiety. It's like I'm mad at anyone adding any more anxiety to my day because they're not following the exactly laid plans I've created to curb any anxiety inducing situations. So I get mad at them for causing more anxiety.

But really I'm just being a jerk off and projecting my anxiety and feelings onto them."
Today at therapy,Congratulations! Thank you for sharing your success story. It gives me hope! 
A trick I used during a panic attack that actually helped!,"My therapist calls this ""grounding"". If you can be self-aware enough to do this, it can help. I thought it might be good to just get in the habit of doing this regularly, so that it would be easier to remember to do when needed, but I keep forgetting."
So I‚Äôm having brain surgery,Sending you good vibes for surgery and a quick recovery! 
What if people looked at physical ailments the way they look at anxiety and depression?,"I think about this all the time. Can't really request the day off work because depression,  anxiety is extreme today, but you can have a day off for your flu"
I'm Agoraphobic and have a lot of anxiety riding in cars atm. Today I got out of my city and rode to the next town over (15 mn drive) and I was okay! :-D,"I am so very goddamn proud of you.
At my worst, I had to literally have a blanket thrown over my head and stuffed into a car kicking and screaming to go to the doctors because I could not even open my blinds.(Not unlike how you would treat a dangerous wild animal).

It gets better. I promise. A store is huge and you took on a drive and an entire town! I am so proud of you. Really and truly. "
Sertraline saved my life,"i've been on 100g of sertraline since 2012 and it's been a RELIEF!!  for a long time i was against ssris because i had tried them before and they were hell to get off of and i was scared of 'long qt syndrome'.  i asked to be hospitalized when i went on zoloft, at the time i was going to the ER almost every night and had a sketchy ultrasound where the tech thought i might have had ovarian cancer (i flipped out and drove to the hospital, making a scene in the waiting room that i HAD CANCER and threatened to jump off a bridge).  i asked to be admitted and was there for 4 weeks.  after three weeks of the pills, of crying and having constant attacks over and over i woke up one morning NOT thinking i was going to die, and felt so relieved, so awake and so grateful.  i just upped my dose to 125mg in the last few months because my dad passed away and i started getting attacks again, but i will stay on this stuff, no matter how much people in my life look down on me for it (my brother calls it 'zombrex' and tells me i'm being brainwashed by the illuminati, lol).  

i'll take my sanity over constant adrenaline dumps over and over all day, every day, thank you!

i'm in it for the long haul."
"I just can‚Äôt handle the fact that one moment it‚Äôs Saturday morning and next thing you know it‚Äôs Sunday night, and you can‚Äôt do ANYTHING about it. I would do anything to be able to stop time.",I wish i could stop time ive been nervous non stop since yesterday morning i dont wamt to go to school anymore:(
"I have days when I can clearly see how dumb my anxiety is, and then there's days when I'm sucker punched by the very thoughts I laughed at earlier.","I know exactly what you mean, sometimes for me i will even experience that entire cycle in the space of a day....
Its exhausting. "

UPDATE: Two weeks with no panic attacks!!!,Wow good news. I applaud you for the great effort you put in to make sure this happens. Keep it up and keep us updated.
PSA: don't yell at retail workers,"Oh god this happens to me all the time.  My coworkers are always so bewildered as to why I let the ""rude customers get to me.""  I've worked 9 hour shifts every day, every summer for the past 2 years and yet I can still remember every single one of the dozens of rude comments I have received in that time working.  

People have no idea how much it affects your self-esteem either.  To anyone who's reading this, next time you tell a fast-food worker how useless and ""utterly incompetent"" they are, just know that they could very well add that to their catalog of insecurities and harp on that comment for years to come.  I know it's certainly true in my case."
Waking up anxious,"Look up morning cortisol.

It's SUCH a lovely way to wake up, isn't it?

You need to burn it off. Get up and move around. The faster you move, the faster it goes away."
Does anyone else hold their breath without realizing it when you're really anxious?,Yes and I tighten my stomach muscles in. When I‚Äôm finally alone and can relax I usually have bad stomach pains.
"Anxiety won today, and I stayed in bed till 7pm.",[deleted]
Anyone ever feel like their personality is fading away?,"I totally feel that way I‚Äôm 34, and I feel like i am finally (barely) getting to know who I am. "
Freaking hot,"Yes, definitely. Also extreme cold, but heat is worse.

Really, with any discomfort comes anxiety."
I finally changed my facebook profile picture-despite anxiety about doing so!,"Small steps are so important, don‚Äôt let that it‚Äôs small take away from your accomplishment because those little steps build on themselves to turn into something big. I‚Äôm proud of you!"
Am I the only person who will do something socially embarrassing and have it play in their heads over and over again?,I‚Äôve had many sleeplessness nights replaying events over and over trying to determine every possible way I could have improved the situation. My solution is regular mediation to accept my thoughts and weed before bed to knock me out.

Does anyone else just sometimes collapse and become a shell of a person for maybe weeks at a time?,always. i'm just so hungry and sleepy all the time these days.
Fuck health anxiety,[deleted]
I GOT AN INTERNSHIP!,"I'm SO proud of you! That's amazing! Congratulations, wishing you the very best."
More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering From Severe Anxiety,[deleted]
Welp I finally did it. Took myself to the hospital for suicidal/violent thoughts. Currently waiting to be seen,"Just wanted to say that I work at a hospital; if they assign someone to sit with you they aren't judging you, they're just there to ensure your continued safety. Please don't take it the wrong way. The majority of hospital workers are very caring people and just want to keep you safe. "
"My cat knows when I‚Äôm having a panic attack and does her best to ground me and help me calm down during, even though she‚Äôs normally not affectionate in that way.","Awe looks like your kitty adopted you back! Your kitty should be a therapy cat! Just for you, of course. It‚Äôs funny how some animals recognize our emotions and try and calm us down for it. "
"What do you guys do to help with ""next day anxiety?""","Wondering this as well, luckily j have a job that I can bury my head in a set kf headphones in and listen to podcasts in order to keep me distracted. I still absolutely dread going on the next day though. Sorry I'm not more help. "
I went to therapy!,"My biggest lesson after starting therapy was allowing yourself time for the emotional exhaustion afterwards. Give yourself some cooling off time after appointments, it‚Äôs hard to go straight from the therapists out in to the real world. Very happy for you! "
My therapist had me try Brainspotting on Friday. Holy shit.,What is brain spotting? Can you describe what she instructed you to do?
"One day, i just want to sit down, and know everything's going to be okay.","Me too, buddy. It's achievable, but it doesn't happen on it's own, nor overnight. Be patient and determined; things will improve."

Does anyone else feel very nervous about answering text messages?,I always take longer than I should when answering important emails or texts.
Does anybody else avoid speaking to friends because you worry that they might not reply because they secretly hate you?,"Yes!  I am always worried people are mad at me or that I will say or do something stupid TO get people mad at me.  Unfortunatly, I usually cope with this by just not calling people and not making plans with people which doesn't help at all:/  "
I want this.,"I'd prefer one that says ""I can't keep calm, but I'll carry on"""
Does anyone repeat TV shows or movies to sooth anxiety?,Yes! I seem to only enjoy doing it with The Office though. Not sure why
I spend so much energy coping with anxiety and suppressing anxious thoughts that I have no energy left to be in the moment or learn anything,"I think working on mindfulness and self-compassion might be helpful for you (not a cure but have made a huge difference for me). Look for 'Self-Compassion: The Proven Power of Being Kind to Yourself' by Kristen Neff. Cheesy title I know, but they always are. I have it on audiobook and I've gone through it multiple times and just hit play sometimes when I'm feeling awful or getting into negative thought spirals. 

Mindfulness is helpful for anyone but it comes to mind because you mentioned suppressing thoughts, which is a natural inclination but ultimately, usually counterproductive. To not think about something you have to think about it. I find ""noting"" good practice. Whatever you're doing, take a moment to note every single thing you're feeling, inside and out. I like to practice this walking to and from work. The muscles in my chest are tight, especially the left side over the heart. My right ankle itches. There's a pebble in my shoe. I can hear the sewer still draining after last night's rain. Birds are chirping. My forehead is starting to sweat. I can smell fertilizer from this house's lawn...

Another part of that, which is new to me and I've just started working on, is noting the anxious thoughts and feelings (i.e., not trying to suppress them). The idea is that you can't be ruled by a feeling you're aware is occurring. More complicated for physiological anxiety problems, true, but I still find it helpful. Because for certain things that cause huge anxiety (beyond my baseline anxiousness) I tend to think I need to get out of that state in order to do it. Right now my dissertation is a source. So I'm working on just welcoming and noting all the anxious and negative feelings and thoughts. Like, instead of putting so much mental energy into ""you want this. You need this. It's okay. It's just impostor syndrome. You're not a failure. There's no disaster,"" I'm working on ""this is really awful and I feel terrified I'm going to be a failure. My breathing is changing just thinking about it. This fucking sucks and that's ok."" It's hard, but it's worth it and helpful IMO. "
Does anyone else experience depression in the winter and anxiety in the summer?,I definitely get summer anxiety. Everything is so bright and warm and uncomfortable and for some reason this really throws me off.
Yeah...basically üòï,TIL depression is a Hanzo main.
